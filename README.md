  <em>The Orbit dashboard (<code>orbit web serve</code>) — task backlog, live audit log, per-agent scoreboard.</em>
</p>

**Orbit brings engineering rigor to AI-assisted coding. Tasks for every change, ADRs for load-bearing decisions, structured audit of every tool call and provider exchange, conflict-aware parallel dispatch — local-first.**

You drive Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build, or Gemini CLI against real code, often in parallel. Agents make it easy to skip the disciplines that keep code maintainable — no plan, no decision record, no audit trail, just prompt-and-merge. Six months later you can't reconstruct why an agent wrote a given line. Orbit makes those disciplines cheap and enforces them by default: tasks before edits, ADRs for load-bearing decisions, every tool call landing in a structured audit log, parallel runs sandboxed into worktrees with file-level locks.

The constraints are the point — they're what keep agent-assisted code shippable at volume. And the history of decisions lives right alongside the code, so that agents (and you) can reconstruct how the code came to be.

## Primary Features

- **Durable, intent-tracked task layer.** Lifecycle (`proposed → backlog → in-progress → review → done`) survives sessions and branches; every commit carries the `task_id`, so `orbit task show` reconstructs prompt, plan, execution trace, and review threads months later. → [docs/design/task-artifacts/](docs/design/task-artifacts/)

- **ADRs as first-class state.** Capture load-bearing decisions as ADR artifacts with status lifecycle (`proposed → accepted → superseded`), owner, related_tasks/features, and supersession chains — authored and queried via `orbit.adr.*`, cross-referenced from task IDs and commit messages. → [docs/design/adr-artifact/](docs/design/adr-artifact/)

- **Shared learnings, smarter agents.** Non-obvious knowledge — gotchas, root causes, validated approaches — captured once as scoped `L<date>-N` records that inject into any agent's context automatically when relevant code is touched (engine pre-prompt, MCP sidecar, optional `PreToolUse` hook). Authored via `orbit.learning.*`, checked into git so what one agent learns the next one inherits. → [docs/design/project-learnings/](docs/design/project-learnings/)

- **Structured audit log.** Every tool call, provider request/response, and task transition becomes a queryable event with agent identity attached — append-only, tamper-evident, exportable. → [docs/design/auditability/](docs/design/auditability/)

- **Knowledge-graph–aware tooling.** Agents query a parsed, content-addressed graph (symbols, imports, callers, implementors) instead of grep. Branch-scoped and safe for parallel rebuild; numbers in [`benchmarks/graph/`](benchmarks/graph/). → [docs/design/knowledge-graph/](docs/design/knowledge-graph/)

- **Conflict-aware parallel execution.** For `orbit run ship`, each agent run lands in its own git worktree per task, and the gate pipeline reserves task `context_files` as locks before fanning out, rejecting overlapping reservations up front instead of producing merge conflicts later (see [merge throughput chart](docs/assets/merge-throughput.png)). → [docs/design/activity-job/](docs/design/activity-job/)

- **Sandboxed-by-default execution.** Dispatched agent CLIs run under an OS-level sandbox out of the box — FS access scoped to the worktree, network egress gated by per-activity policy. **macOS only today** (via `sandbox-exec`); on Linux/Windows the agent subprocess runs unsandboxed, with in-process FS guards still covering HTTP tools. → [docs/design/policy-sandbox](docs/design/policy-sandbox/)

## Quick Start

### Setup via Agent Prompt (clone & build) - Recommended

Cloning is the recommended and best way to get started with Orbit. Curl/brew/plugin paths give you a binary; cloning gives you a customizable framework to mold into your team's conventions. No need to contribute back to Orbit unless you want to, you can just fork it.

- If you need to build your custom workflow, ask the agent directly.
- If you don't like any orbit conventions, ask the agent to tweak it.
- If something doesn't work, ask the agent to fix it.
- If you need a new feature, ask the agent to add it.
- If you are unsure about any orbit features, ask the agent to help you.

Paste the prompt below into your agent (Claude Code, Codex CLI, or Gemini CLI) **from inside the repo where you want to use Orbit**. The agent clones Orbit, builds from source, sets up MCP, and reads the key docs so it can drive the workflow on your behalf afterwards.

> You are helping me set up Orbit, a local governance and audit layer for coding agents.
>
> I am a staff/principal/founding engineer who already uses multiple coding agents heavily (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Aider, etc.) and has started to feel the long-term maintainability cost of moving fast without enough structure.
>
> Your job is to install and configure Orbit inside this repository so that I can keep using my existing agents while gaining durable tasks, structured audit, ADRs, safe parallel execution, and a code knowledge graph.
>
> Follow these steps carefully:
>
> 1. Ask me where I want to clone the Orbit repository (suggest something like `~/code/orbit` or `~/dev/orbit`).
> 2. Verify the Rust toolchain. Run `cargo --version` and `rustc --version`. Orbit uses edition 2024, so I need Rust **1.85 or newer**. If cargo is missing, or rustc is older than 1.85, **stop and ask me before installing anything** — the canonical path is `rustup` (`curl https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`), but that modifies shell profile, so I want to confirm first. If rustup is already installed but the toolchain is old, suggest `rustup update stable` and confirm before running.
> 3. Clone `https://github.com/danieljhkim/orbit` into the location from step 1, then run `make install`. This builds with cargo and copies the `orbit` binary to `$INSTALL_BIN_DIR` (default: `~/.cargo/bin`). Confirm the install path with me before running. Verify with `orbit --version`.
> 4. Run `orbit init` to initialize global state at `~/.orbit`.
> 5. From *this* repository (not the Orbit clone), run `orbit workspace init --mcp`. This creates `.orbit/` here and auto-registers Orbit's MCP server with installed agent CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini).
> 6. Ask me whether to enable semantic search (**optional**). `orbit semantic install` downloads a small embedder companion plus the default bge-small model (lives under `~/.orbit/embed/`) and powers `orbit.semantic.search` / `orbit.semantic.related` over tasks. Don't install without my OK. If I accept and tasks already exist in this workspace, also run `orbit semantic reindex` to backfill the corpus.
> 7. Read the key documents so you actually understand the model:
>    - `README.md` — feature surface, install model, plugin vs CLI
>    - `docs/POSITIONING.md` — what Orbit is for, what it isn't (especially "who this is for")
>    - `CLAUDE.md` — agent operating rules (commit timing, task ID convention, lint constraints)
>    - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — crate layering and dependency rules
>    - `docs/design/CONVENTIONS.md` — design-doc structure
>    - `docs/CONFIG.md` — config reference: crew/workflow/duel knobs and per-task crew override
> 8. After setup, run `orbit task list` and `orbit semantic stats` and show me the output.
> 9. Ask me what my first real task should be and create it properly using Orbit's task surface (use the `orbit-create-task` skill — it should be auto-discovered after step 5).
>
> Rules:
> - Never run destructive commands without explicit confirmation. Specifically: cloning, installing rustup, running `make install` outside `~/.cargo/bin`, and any shell-profile modification all need a confirmation prompt.
> - If anything is unclear or fails, stop and ask me.
> - Do not try to "make it simpler" or hide Orbit's conventions. I am choosing this because I want the discipline.
>
> Report back what you did and the current state of the workspace.

### Manual Setup (old school way)

Not recommended unless you're a contrarian or you're in a highly restricted environment where you can't clone things. This way is harder and less flexible - really makes little sense to choose this route. But if you must:

**Prerequisites:** at least one supported agent CLI (Codex, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI), authenticated. For PR-based workflows (i.e., `orbit run ship` in the default `--mode pr`), `gh` installed and authenticated; otherwise use `--mode local`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual setup commands</strong> — copy these into your terminal (click to expand)</summary>

```bash
# install
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danieljhkim/orbit/main/install.sh | sh
# or: brew install danieljhkim/tap/orbit
# or, in Claude Code:
#   /plugin marketplace add danieljhkim/orbit
#   /plugin install orbit

# initialize
orbit init                                 # global state (~/.orbit)
cd <repo> && orbit workspace init --mcp    # workspace state + MCP integration

# create, approve, and ship a task
TASK_ID=$(orbit task add \
  --title "..." \
  --description "..." \
  --acceptance-criteria "..." \
  --workspace .)

# or simply ask an agent to create a task:
# "Claude can you create an orbit task to refactor the authentication logic in ..."

orbit task approve "$TASK_ID"

# conflict-aware, parallel flush of the backlog tasks to PRs
orbit run ship

# launch interactive dashboard
orbit web serve
```

## Semantic Search (optional)

Opt-in hybrid (embedding + BM25) search over task fields via `orbit.semantic.search` / `orbit.semantic.related`. **Scope today is tasks only** — graph, ADRs, learnings, and code are not indexed. The embedder runs as a separate companion subprocess, so semantic search has zero cost when unused.

```bash
orbit semantic install    # one-time: download companion + default model (bge-small)
orbit semantic reindex    # backfill existing tasks
orbit semantic search "race in the scheduler when locks overlap"
```

After install, task writes are embedded automatically in the background; `reindex` is only needed for the initial backfill. Companion + models live under `~/.orbit/embed/`; the per-workspace index at `.orbit/state/semantic.db`.

---

## Claude Code Plugin vs CLI

Two install surfaces. The CLI gives you the full power of Orbit. Choose the plugin if you just want a taste. Plugin will strap orbit's MCP tools automatically.

```bash
/plugin marketplace add danieljhkim/orbit

# Install the plugin
/plugin install orbit
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Plugin vs. CLI</strong> — (click to expand)</summary>

|   | **Claude Code plugin** | **CLI (curl / brew)** |
|---|---|---|
| Install | `/plugin install orbit` (after `/plugin marketplace add danieljhkim/orbit`) | `curl … \| sh` or `brew install danieljhkim/tap/orbit` |
| Orbit binary | Lives inside the plugin sandbox (not on `$PATH`) | Installed on `$PATH` |
| MCP registration | Automatic | Manual: `orbit workspace init --mcp` per workspace |
| Web dashboard (`orbit web serve`) | No | Yes |
| Works with Codex / Gemini CLI | No (Claude Code only) | Yes |
| workflows (i.e. `orbit run ship`) | No | Yes |

</details>

## Agent Skills

`orbit workspace init` seeds skill files under `~/.orbit/skills/` and symlinks them into `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.agents/skills/`, so Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI discover them at session start with no per-agent configuration. The router skill (`orbit`) classifies intent; workflow-specific skills do the work:

- `orbit-create-task` — author a task with strong acceptance criteria
- `orbit-execute-task` — carry an approved task through implementation and review
- `orbit-review-task` — file findings on another agent's work without transitioning status
- `orbit-adr` — author, accept, or supersede an Architecture Decision Record
- `orbit-graph` — query the parsed knowledge graph (callers, implementors, refs)
- `orbit-semantic` — find tasks by topic; dedup and related-task lookups
- `orbit-debug-job-failure` — diagnose failed, stuck, or cancelled runs
- `orbit-track-issues` — capture agent-self-reported friction with Orbit tooling itself

`orbit skill doctor` flags drift between the local copy and the upstream definition. Edit any seeded `SKILL.md` to customize behavior for your team.

## Workspace Layout of `.orbit`

- `orbit workspace init` creates a `.orbit/` directory at the repo root. Workspace-local state lives there; removing the directory returns the workspace to a pre-init state.
- `orbit init` creates a `.orbit/` directory in the user's home (`~/.orbit/`). User-scoped state lives there; removing the directory returns the user environment to a pre-init state.

```
.orbit/                          # workspace-local (safe to delete → clean slate)
├── config.yaml                  # workspace_id + config

├── embed/                       # semantic companion binary + models
└── config.toml                  # global settings
```

Couple things to note:
- **`tasks/`** is a projection. Canonical task bundles live under `~/.orbit/tasks/workspaces/<workspace-id>/<task-id>/` so they survive repo moves; `.orbit/tasks/` is rebuildable from the canonical store. See [docs/design/task-artifacts/](docs/design/task-artifacts/).

- Global state — credentials, the canonical task store, and cross-workspace config — lives under `~/.orbit/`, created by `orbit init`. The recommended `.gitignore` pattern is `.orbit/*` with `!.orbit/adrs/` and `!.orbit/learnings/` un-ignored, so local runtime state stays out of the repo while project memory stays in.

---

## Current Status

Orbit is v0.5.x — work in progress.

- Core local execution, graph build/query, workflows, MCP, tasks, reviews, ADRs, frictions, and audit infrastructure are usable today.
