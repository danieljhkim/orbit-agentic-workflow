  <em>The Orbit dashboard (<code>orbit web serve</code>) — task backlog, live audit log, per-agent scoreboard.</em>
</p>

**Orbit is a durable, intent-tracked, auditable task layer for developers driving AI coding agents at high volume — local-first by design, with a path to team-scale automation as trust in agents matures.**

You drive multiple coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and any OpenAI-compatible or Ollama-served model) against real code. Ideas accumulate faster than any session can hold, work spans branches and weeks, and six months from now you have to remember *why* an agent wrote a given line. Agent vendors solve in-session execution. Orbit is the layer above — local-first state that turns individual agent sessions into a coherent, auditable body of work.

Full positioning, commercial model, and roadmap: [docs/POSITIONING.md](docs/POSITIONING.md).

## Primary Features

- **Durable, intent-tracked task layer.** Lifecycle (`proposed → backlog → in-progress → review → done`) survives sessions, branches, and weeks. Every commit carries the `task_id`; `orbit task show` reconstructs prompt, plan, execution trace, and review threads months later.

- **Auditability.** Every tool call, provider request/response, and task transition is a structured, queryable event with agent identity attached. Append-only, tamper-evident, exportable. → [docs/design/auditability/](docs/design/auditability/)

- **Knowledge-graph–aware tooling.** Agents query a parsed, content-addressed graph (symbols, imports, callers, implementors) instead of grep. Branch-scoped, safe for parallel rebuild. The graph is what makes audit cheap to populate; benchmark in [`benchmarks/graph/`](benchmarks/graph/). → [docs/design/knowledge-graph/](docs/design/knowledge-graph/)

- **Conflict-aware parallel execution.** Each agent run is dispatched into its own git worktree, and the gate pipeline reserves task `context_files` as locks before fanning out — overlapping reservations are rejected up front rather than producing merge conflicts later. Locks auto-release when their owning run reaches a terminal state. Agents themselves do not call the lock APIs; coordination happens at the workflow plane. → [docs/design/activity-job/](docs/design/activity-job/)

> **Platform:** OS-level sandbox enforcement is **macOS only** (via `sandbox-exec`). On Linux/Windows, FS policies still apply as in-process guards for HTTP-tool calls; the spawned agent subprocess runs without OS-level isolation.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** at least one supported agent CLI (Codex, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI), authenticated. For PR-based execution, `gh` installed and authenticated; otherwise use `--mode local`.

```bash
# install
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danieljhkim/orbit/agent-main/install.sh | sh
# or: brew install danieljhkim/tap/orbit
# or, in Claude Code:
#   /plugin marketplace add danieljhkim/orbit
#   /plugin install orbit
# Claude Code plugin install takes ~30s on first use (downloads the
# platform-matched orbit binary from GitHub Releases via @orbit-tools/cli).
# After install you get the Orbit MCP tool surface (orbit.task.*,
# orbit.graph.*, etc.) plus the orbit skills and orchestration subagents.
# Verified weekly on macOS and Linux; Windows is not supported by the npm
# install path. Release procedure: docs/RELEASE.md.

# initialize
orbit init                                 # global state (~/.orbit)
cd <repo> && orbit workspace init --mcp    # workspace state + MCP integration

# launch interactive dashboard
orbit web serve

# create, approve, and ship a task
TASK_ID=$(orbit task add \
  --title "..." \
  --description "..." \
  --acceptance-criteria "..." \
  --workspace .)

# or simply ask an agent to create a task:
"Claude can you create an orbit task to refactor the authentication 
logic in ..."

orbit task approve "$TASK_ID"

orbit run ship-auto      # conflict-aware flush of the backlog tasks to PR
```

## Core Model

- **Task** — durable unit of work, versioned and auditable, scoped to a workspace.
- **Knowledge graph** — parsed structure of your codebase. Branch-scoped; safe for parallel rebuild.
- **Worktree** — each agent session runs in an isolated git worktree.
- **Locks** — explicit claims on files or code regions; reserved before dispatch to prevent overlapping edits.

Substrate primitives (`activity`, `job`, `policy`, `executor`, `tool`) are inspectable on purpose but not the product story.

---

## Current Status

Orbit is v0.4.x — work in progress.

- Core local execution, graph build/query, and audit infrastructure are usable today.
- The execution substrate shows more internal machinery than the final product should; some historical CLI surfaces remain even though they're no longer central.
- Production or multi-machine deployments are not yet recommended.

Intentional technical debt on the path toward a tighter product focused on the audit and task layer.

## Commercial Model

OSS (this repo, MIT/Apache 2.0) is the full solo-wedge experience — free forever for self-hosted individuals and small teams. **Orbit Team** is a planned hosted multi-tenant SKU for engineering organizations. Full structure: [POSITIONING § Commercial model](docs/POSITIONING.md#commercial-model-open-core-two-tiers).
