# Orbit Website — Design

**Status:** Draft

## 1. Purpose & Audience

The Orbit website is a **documentation site**, not a marketing site. It exists to host:

- Reference documentation (CLI commands, activity/job YAML schemas, policy formats)
- How-to guides (task lifecycle, writing activities, scoping rules)
- Architecture and design docs (surface the `docs/design/` tree in readable form)
- Conceptual explainers (activity/job model, knowledge graph, agent runtimes)

**Primary audience:** engineers evaluating or actively using Orbit. They arrive via search, know roughly what they want, and leave as soon as they have it. The site optimizes for that path.

**Non-goals:**
- Lead generation, conversion funnels, email capture
- Blog, changelog-as-narrative, release announcements (those live in `CHANGELOG.md` and git)
- Interactive playgrounds or live demos (revisit if Orbit grows a hosted offering)

---

## 2. Design Principles

1. **Reference-heavy, search-first.** Users land via `⌘K` or Google. Every page must be findable and self-contained.
2. **Minimalism as a feature.** Restraint is the aesthetic. One accent color, one type family per role, no decorative motion in docs content.
3. **Legibility over personality.** The orbit metaphor shows up structurally (logo, section glyphs) — never at the cost of reading comfort.
4. **Static and fast.** Zero JS by default. Hundreds of pages should feel identical in performance to ten.
5. **Dark-default, light-available.** Theme toggle persists per user; neither mode is an afterthought.

## 3. Visual System

### 3.1 Palette (dark, default)

| Role              | Value       | Notes                                      |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Background        | `#0A0A0A`   | Near-black; avoids pure-black eye strain   |
| Surface           | `#17171A`   | Cards, code blocks, sidebar hover          |
| Border            | `#26262B`   | Structural only; never decorative          |
| Body text         | `#EDEDEF`   | Off-white; softer than `#FFFFFF`           |
| Muted text        | `#9B9BA3`   | Metadata, captions, inactive nav           |
| Accent            | `#6E9FFF`   | Neptune blue; links, active nav, focus     |
| Accent (hover)    | `#8AB3FF`   | One step brighter                          |

Light mode is the same roles inverted; accent stays the same hue, darkened for AA contrast.

### 3.2 Typography

| Role              | Family                         | Size / Line-height      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Body              | Inter or Geist Sans            | 16px / 1.65              |
| Headings          | Same sans, tighter tracking    | h1 2rem · h2 1.5rem · h3 1.25rem |
| Code (inline/block) | Geist Mono or JetBrains Mono | 14px / 1.6               |
| UI (nav, search)  | Same sans as body              | 14px                     |

No display font. No serif anywhere.

### 3.3 Orbit motif (sparing use)

- **Logo:** a single thin ring with an offset dot. Must be legible at 16px favicon size.
- **Section dividers** in long pages: 1px rule with a small ring glyph centered.
- **Landing page only:** one slow-rotating orbit diagram in the hero. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- No starfields, parallax, planet illustrations, or animation anywhere inside docs content.

### 3.4 Layout

Three-column, fixed:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Logo           Search (⌘K)              GitHub  ☾   │
├──────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────┤
│  Nav     │  Content (max ~720px)     │  On this page │
│  (left)  │                           │  (right)      │
│          │                           │               │
└──────────┴───────────────────────────┴───────────────┘
```

- Left nav: collapsible sections. Active page marked with a 2px accent bar on the left edge.
- Content column: max-width ~720px, measure 65–75ch for prose.
- Right rail: sticky "On this page" TOC. Muted until the corresponding section is in view.
- Top bar: logo, search, GitHub, theme toggle. Nothing else.

## 4. Information Architecture

Initial top-level sections (left nav, in order):

1. **Introduction** — what Orbit is, who it's for, 2-minute read
2. **Getting Started** — install, first task, activity catalog
3. **Concepts** — tasks, activities/jobs, policies, knowledge graph, agents
4. **How-to Guides** — task-oriented recipes
5. **Reference** — CLI, YAML schemas, config, scoping rules
6. **Architecture** — surfaced from `docs/design/`, read-only mirror
7. **Contributing** — local dev, crate layout, PR workflow

Each section has an index page that lists its children with one-line descriptions. No "coming soon" placeholders — sections appear only when populated.

---

## 5. Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build)
- **Search:** Pagefind (built into Starlight, static, offline, no third-party account)
- **Content:** MDX in `src/content/docs/`
- **Styling:** Starlight's CSS custom properties, overridden in a single `custom.css`
- **Hosting:** TBD (Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, or GitHub Pages — all work with Astro's static output)
- **Repo layout:** new top-level `website/` directory, independent of the Rust workspace

### 5.1 Why Starlight over Nextra

- Docs-first defaults map 1:1 to this site's stated values
- Zero JS by default → consistent perf as the site grows
- Pagefind search is excellent and fully static
- Less framework surface to fight when enforcing minimalism

Nextra is reserved for a future scenario where interactive React widgets become core content (API explorers, config builders). Not a concern at launch.

## 6. Content Conventions

- **Page frontmatter:** `title`, `description` required; `sidebar.order` optional.
- **Headings:** start at `h2` within content (Starlight renders `h1` from frontmatter).
- **Code blocks:** always language-tagged. Long examples collapsible.
- **Cross-links:** relative paths only; no hardcoded domains.
- **Task references:** when a doc cites an Orbit task, link format is `[T20260423-001234](../architecture/...)` or inline code if unresolved.
- **Voice:** terse, declarative, second-person ("you run", not "the user runs"). No marketing adjectives.

## 7. Open Questions

1. **Domain name.** `orbit.dev`, `orbitcli.dev`, subdomain of an existing property? orbit-cli.com
2. **Versioning.** Starlight supports versioned docs via directory structure. Needed at v1? Probably no — add when Orbit has breaking releases.
3. **Architecture mirror.** Do we render `docs/design/**/*.md` directly, or hand-curate a summary? Leaning toward direct render with a build-time copy step to preserve single source of truth.
4. **Logo design.** Ring-with-offset-dot concept agreed; actual SVG not yet drawn.
5. **Analytics.** Plausible (privacy-respecting) or none at all? Default to none unless there's a decision to measure something specific.

## 8. Out of Scope (explicitly)

- Interactive code playgrounds
- Authenticated / gated content
- Localization (revisit if Orbit gains non-English contributors at scale)
- Comments, discussions, or embedded social
- A blog
