## Envelope

```yaml
schemaVersion: 2
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  denyRead: []
  denyModify: []
  fsProfiles: {}
```

## Global Denies

`denyRead` blocks reads. `denyModify` blocks writes. These rules accumulate globally and apply after the selected filesystem profile is resolved.

```yaml
denyRead:
  - "**/*.env"
denyModify:
  - .orbit/**
  - "**/*.env"
```

## Filesystem Profiles

Profiles describe allowed read and modify globs.

```yaml
fsProfiles:
  reviewer:
    read: [./**]
    modify: []
  implementer:
    read: [./**]
    modify:
      - crates/**
      - docs/**
```

An activity selects a profile with `fsProfile`.

```yaml
spec:
  type: agent_loop
  fsProfile: implementer
```

> **Platform support.** OS-level enforcement of the resolved profile for spawned agent CLIs is **macOS only**, via `sandbox-exec`. On Linux and Windows the same policy YAML is parsed and applied to in-process FS-tool calls, but no kernel-level sandbox wraps the agent subprocess.
