//! Executor types and activity execution model for the Orbit engine.
//!
//! Defines the [`ActivityExecutor`] trait and its implementations:
//! - `direct_agent` — spawns an agent process directly from an ExecutorDef
//! - `automation` — runs built-in automation logic (task status updates, etc.)
//! - `cli_command` — executes an Orbit CLI sub-command as an activity step
//!
//! The `registry` module maps `spec_type` strings to the appropriate executor.
