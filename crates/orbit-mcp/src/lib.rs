#![deny(clippy::print_stderr, clippy::print_stdout)]
//! MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes an Orbit tool surface to
//! any MCP-capable client.
//!
//! The crate is a thin transport adapter between rmcp's server runtime and an
//! Orbit-supplied [`McpHost`]. `orbit-mcp` itself performs no tool dispatch,
//! no policy evaluation, and no audit logging — it delegates each
//! `tools/call` to the host. In the default `orbit-cli` wiring the host is
//! `RuntimeMcpHost`, which brackets every call with an audit boundary
//! (`audited_mcp_call`): the wrapper records a failure-status audit row when
//! preflight rejects an unknown / unexposed tool name, and otherwise dispatches
//! through `OrbitRuntime::execute_tool_command_dispatch` tagged with
//! `ToolEntryPoint::Mcp`, where the runtime persists a success-or-failure
//! audit row with the same identity-resolution rules and policy chain as the
//! CLI path. Audit rows from MCP calls carry `subcommand = "run-mcp"` so they
//! can be filtered apart from CLI tool runs (which carry `"run"`).
//!
//! # Role
//! Depends on `orbit-types` and `orbit-tools` only (for [`orbit_common::types::ToolSchema`]
//! and MCP-shape helpers). The CLI constructs a runtime-backed [`McpHost`] and
//! hands it to [`serve_stdio`]. No dependency on `orbit-core` is introduced.
//!
//! # Transport
//! Only stdio is supported in this cut. HTTP/SSE/streamable-http transports
//! are follow-up work once authentication is in scope.
