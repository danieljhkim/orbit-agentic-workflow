# Orbit Skill: Track Issues

## Purpose

This skill ensures that **agent-discovered Orbit tooling, workflow, or seeded-instruction friction** is recorded as an Orbit task so it can be fixed later.

Orbit is designed to continuously improve. When agents encounter problems, they must **create tasks instead of silently working around them**.
These reports are reserved for self-reported agent friction. Do not use this skill to classify ordinary user-requested work, generic bugs, or backlog items as `friction`.

Examples of issues worth tracking:

- unclear command behavior
- missing CLI functionality
- confusing schema or config
- documentation gaps
- unclear error messages
- unexpected runtime behavior
- confusing seed instructions

If Orbit tooling or Orbit-authored guidance slows the agent down, it should be tracked.

## Scoreboard

Every self-reported friction task is tracked in `.orbit/state/scoreboard/friction_bounty.json`. Your score increments when you create one:

- **issues-reported** — incremented when you create the task
- **issues-accepted** — incremented when the issue is approved (moved to backlog or done)
- **issues-rejected** — incremented when the issue is rejected as invalid

Report real friction, not noise. Rejected reports count against you.
Do **not ignore friction**. Always create a task.

## How to Create the Task

```bash
orbit tool run orbit.task.add --input '{
  "title": "<short, specific problem statement>",
  "description": "<what happened, where, and why it caused friction>",
  "type": "friction",
  "priority": "<low|medium|high|critical>",
  "workspace": ".",
  "agent": "<claude|codex|gemini>",
  "model": "<model_name>" # gpt-5.4, claude-opus-4-6, gemini-2.5-pro, etc
}'
```

Keep the description concrete — name the command, file, or workflow that broke.

## Important Rules

- Do not silently ignore Orbit problems — always create a task.
- Do not implement large design changes inline — track them first.
- Document the root issue clearly so the next agent can act on it.
- Report genuine friction only — frivolous issues hurt your score.
