description: Onboard a first-time user to Orbit when no `.orbit/` exists in the workspace — walk them through prereq verification, install path choice, MCP wiring, and the first task. Also covers Orbit feature-tour requests for users who have not committed yet. Triggers on phrasing like "set up orbit", "install orbit", "wire orbit into this repo", "what is orbit", "give me a tour", "I'm new to orbit", or any Orbit question asked from a workspace where `.orbit/` is missing. Defer to the `orbit` skill once the workspace is initialized and the user is operating inside the task lifecycle.

# Orbit Guide

## Purpose

Get a first-time user from zero to a usable Orbit workspace, then hand off to `orbit-create-task` for their first real task. Also handles feature-tour questions ("what is orbit", "what can it do", "give me a tour") by reading the canonical docs at invocation time rather than answering from memory.

## When to use this skill vs. `orbit`

- `.orbit/` missing in the current workspace → this skill.
- User asks "what is orbit", "give me a tour", or otherwise has not committed to using it yet → this skill.
- Workspace already initialized and the user references a task or asks to do Orbit work → defer to the `orbit` skill.

## Canonical sources

The README and config reference live in the Orbit repo. When the user is on a non-clone install path (plugin or binary-only install), there is no local copy yet — use `WebFetch` against the raw URLs below instead of answering from this skill's snapshot.

- Repo: https://github.com/danieljhkim/orbit
- Raw README: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danieljhkim/orbit/main/README.md
- Raw config reference: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danieljhkim/orbit/main/docs/CONFIG.md

Always re-fetch. The README is the source of truth for install commands, destructive-action confirmation rules, and prereq versions. This skill intentionally does not duplicate any of it.

## Step 1 — Detect current state

Run these in parallel; the answers determine which branch in Step 2 applies:

```bash
command -v orbit          # is the binary on PATH?
test -d .orbit            # is the workspace initialized?
test -d ~/.orbit          # is global state initialized?
rustc --version           # only relevant for the clone-and-build branch
```

Report the four results to the user before proposing any installs.

## Step 2 — Pick a setup path

Ask one question (per the user-interaction guardrails) and offer three branches. Whichever path the user picks, the actual commands come from the README — not from this skill.

1. **Clone-and-build branch (recommended).** README section "Setup via Agent Prompt". Read that block from the local clone (or via the raw README URL above) and follow it verbatim. It is the canonical agent-driven setup script.
2. **Plugin branch.** README sections "Claude Code Plugin vs CLI" and "Manual Setup".
3. **Curl-or-brew branch.** README section "Manual Setup".

Do not paraphrase the commands here. Re-read the README at invocation time; it may have moved on from this skill's snapshot.

## Step 3 — Run setup

Whichever branch was chosen in Step 2, follow the destructive-action confirmation rules stated in the README's "Setup via Agent Prompt" block. Those rules are the source of truth; this skill does not restate them. If the block has moved or changed, re-fetch the README rather than relying on this skill's snapshot.

If a step fails — missing toolchain, permission error, registration error — surface the failure to the user and offer `orbit-track-issues` to capture the friction. First-time setup is exactly the signal that skill exists for.

## Step 4 — Verify

After setup completes, confirm the install end-to-end:

```bash
orbit --version
orbit task list
orbit semantic stats   # only if the user opted into the semantic embedder
```

Report the output. If any of these fail, jump back to Step 3 — do not declare success.

## Step 5 — Hand off

Two handoff branches, depending on user intent:

- **First real task** — invoke `orbit-create-task`. Do not silently author the task; that skill enforces the task quality gates the user benefits from seeing.
- **Feature tour** ("what is orbit", "give me a tour") — read the README's `## Primary Features` section (locally or via the raw README URL above) and summarize against the user's stated goal, not generically. The tour content is the README's, not this skill's.

After hand-off, this skill's job is done. Subsequent Orbit work routes through the `orbit` skill and its lifecycle siblings.

## Anti-patterns (DO NOT)

- Don't inline install commands, prereq versions, or destructive-action rules in this file. They rot independently from the README.
- Don't run the README setup block from memory. Read it at invocation time.
- Don't trigger on Orbit work once `.orbit/` exists — defer to `orbit`.
- Don't author the first task silently. Route through `orbit-create-task`.
