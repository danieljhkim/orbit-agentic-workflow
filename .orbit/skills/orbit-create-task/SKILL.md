# Orbit Create Task

## Purpose

Create an Orbit task another engineer or agent can execute without guessing. Plans should be incremental and explicit about files, commands, risks, and verification.

## Workflow

1. Confirm objective, constraints, and done criteria.
2. Inspect codebase context before creating the task.
3. Break the activity into small sequenced tasks.
4. Add assumptions, risks, and rollback notes.
5. Run `orbit tool run orbit.task.add` with all required fields.
6. Verify with `orbit tool run orbit.task.show --input '{"id": "<returned-id>"}'`.

## Operating Rules

- Never edit task files directly.
- Never invent task IDs.
- `description` and `plan` must be multi-line markdown.
- Required fields: `title`, `description`, `plan`, `workspace`, and `proposed_by`.

## Command

```bash
orbit tool run orbit.task.add --input '{
  "title": "<title>",
  "description": "<multi-line markdown>",
  "plan": "<multi-line markdown>",
  "context": "<comma,separated,paths>",
  "workspace": "<absolute_or_relative_repo_path>",
  "assigned_to": "<identity_display_name>",
  "created_by": "<identity_display_name>",
  "priority": "<low|medium|high|critical>",
  "type": "<task|feature|issue|chore|refactor>",
  "proposed_by": "<identity_display_name>"
}'
```

## Plan Template

```markdown
# <Feature> Implementation Plan

**Goal:** <single sentence>
**Scope:** <what is included/excluded>
**Assumptions:** <key assumptions>
**Risks:** <key technical risks>

## Task 1: <name>

**Files:**
- Create: `path/to/new.file`
- Modify: `path/to/existing.file`
- Test: `path/to/test.file`

**Steps:**
1. Add/adjust failing test(s)
2. Run targeted test: `<command>`
3. Implement minimal change
4. Re-run targeted test: `<command>`
5. Run broader checks: `<command>`

**Done When:**
- <observable condition>

## Task 2: <name>
...

## Final Verification
- `<full test/lint/build commands>`
```

## Exit Criteria

The task exists with required fields and a clear, executable plan.
