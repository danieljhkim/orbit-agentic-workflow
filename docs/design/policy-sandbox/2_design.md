# Policy & Sandboxing — Design

**Status:** Draft
**Owner:** claude
**Last updated:** 2026-04-28

This document describes Orbit's shipped policy and sandboxing implementation: the v2 `PolicyDef` schema, profile resolution and the implicit `unrestricted` fallback, deny-rule injection, last-match-wins path evaluation, the `orbit-policy` engine facade, tool-layer enforcement in `orbit-tools`, the activity/job binding that threads an `fsProfile` through every dispatcher path, the `orbit-exec` spawn primitive, and the process supervision layer that handles timeouts, signals, and orphan reaping. See [1_overview.md](./1_overview.md) for purpose and [3_vision.md](./3_vision.md) for forward-looking gaps.

---

## 1. Policy Schema

The policy schema lives on `PolicyDef` in `crates/orbit-common/src/types/policy_def.rs`. A v2 policy declares:

- `name`
- optional `description`
- `denyRead` — global read-denial rules applied to every profile
- `denyModify` — global modify-denial rules applied to every profile
- `fsProfiles` — a map of profile name to `FsProfile { read, modify }`

`crates/orbit-common/src/types/resource.rs` rejects `schemaVersion: 1` at load time with an explicit migration message ("policy schemaVersion 1 is no longer supported; migrate to schemaVersion 2 with `spec.denyRead`, `spec.denyModify`, and `spec.fsProfiles`"). v2 is the only accepted shape.

`PolicyDef::validate` enforces three structural invariants beyond rule normalization:

1. Every profile name is non-empty.
2. A profile's `modify` rule must be covered by at least one `read` rule in the same profile. The validator rejects modify-only writeable paths because a tool needs to read a path to make a meaningful modification, and granting modify without read produces a confusing audit story.
3. A profile rule that exactly duplicates a global `denyRead` or `denyModify` entry is rejected. Profiles can use negations to refine globals, but cannot copy a denied rule and effectively re-allow it by ordering.

`PolicyDef::merged(global, workspace)` is the merge contract: workspace `fsProfiles` overwrite global entries by name, while global `denyRead` / `denyModify` accumulate (workspace cannot remove a global deny). Merging always re-runs `validate`.

---

## 2. Profile Resolution

`PolicyDef::effective_profile(profile_name)` returns a `ResolvedFsProfile { name, read, modify }` after applying three transformations:

1. **Lookup.** If `fs_profiles` contains `profile_name`, that profile's rule lists are the base. If not and `profile_name == "unrestricted"`, the resolver synthesizes `FsProfile { read: ["./**"], modify: ["./**"] }`. Any other missing profile name returns `OrbitError::InvalidInput`.
2. **Normalization.** Each rule is trimmed, backslashes are flipped to forward slashes, leading `./` segments are stripped, and the rule is rejected if it escapes the workspace (`~`, `~/`, absolute paths, parent traversals). Rules also compile to a glob-equivalent regex for evaluation.
3. **Deny injection.** Every entry in `denyRead` is appended to the profile's `read` list as a negated rule (`!<rule>`); every entry in `denyModify` is appended to the profile's `modify` list as a negated rule. This is the mechanism that makes deny rules global without a separate evaluation pass.

The implicit `unrestricted` profile only materializes if both conditions hold: the activity omitted `fsProfile:` *and* the policy did not define a profile named `unrestricted`. A policy author who defines `unrestricted` shadows the implicit fallback, which is the intended escape hatch for narrowing a workspace's "unrestricted" mode.

---

## 3. Path Evaluation

`PolicyDef::check_path(profile, op, path)` returns an `FsCheckResult { allowed, matched_rule }`. The algorithm:

1. Resolve the profile (via §2).
2. Pick the rule list by operation (`read` or `modify`).
3. If the list is empty, deny with `matched_rule = "[]"`.
4. Walk every rule in order, recording the most recent match. The rule is split into negated/positive form, compiled to a regex, and matched against the normalized workspace-relative path. Later matches override earlier ones — this is **last-match-wins**, not first-match.
5. After the walk, if any rule matched, the decision uses the last match's negation flag. If no rule matched but the list contained at least one positive rule, deny with `matched_rule = "<no matching rule>"`. If the list contained only negated rules, treat that as an empty positive set and deny with `matched_rule = "[]"`.

Path normalization (`normalize_path`) trims, flips slashes, strips `./` prefixes, and rejects absolute paths or `~`-anchored paths. Tool callers are expected to canonicalize first and then express the path workspace-relative — `crates/orbit-tools/src/builtin/fs/mod.rs::workspace_relative_path` handles that on the call site.

The glob-to-regex translator supports `*` (single-segment wildcard), `**` (cross-segment wildcard), `?` (single character within a segment), and `<prefix>/**` (directory subtree match). The translator is intentionally narrow; it is not a full POSIX glob.

---

## 4. PolicyEngine Facade

`crates/orbit-policy/src/lib.rs` re-exports `PolicyEngine`, `FsPolicyEvaluation`, and `PolicyDecision`. The engine wraps a validated `PolicyDef` and exposes one operational method:

```
PolicyEngine::check(profile, operation, path) -> FsPolicyEvaluation
```

`FsPolicyEvaluation` is the struct callers receive: `{ profile, operation, path, allowed, matched_rule }`. The evaluator module (`evaluator.rs`) is a thin pass-through to `PolicyDef::check_path`; the indirection exists so future evaluators (e.g. caching, layered profiles) can replace the implementation without changing the engine surface.

`PolicyDecision` (`crates/orbit-common/src/types/policy_decision.rs`) is a separate `Allow | Deny { reason }` enum used by the broader policy/RBAC framing. It is currently a re-export from `orbit-policy::decision` and is not generated by `PolicyEngine::check` — that path returns the richer `FsPolicyEvaluation` instead. The decision enum exists for non-fs callers and for future allow/deny answers that do not carry `matched_rule` semantics.

---

## 5. Tool-Layer Enforcement

`crates/orbit-tools/src/builtin/fs/mod.rs::enforce_fs_policy` is the only place fs operations consult the policy engine today. The flow:

1. Read `ctx.fs_profile` (the profile name string set by the runtime when constructing the `ToolContext`).
2. Read `ctx.policy_engine` (the `Arc<PolicyEngine>` set by the runtime).
3. If either is missing, return `Ok(None)` — fs work proceeds unguarded. This is the "no policy installed" path used in unit tests and is not reachable from a real v2 host.
4. Convert the canonical filesystem path to a workspace-relative form (`workspace_relative_path`).
5. Call `policy_engine.check(profile, op, path)`.
6. Build an `FsPolicyAllowance` carrying `{ profile, op, path, matched_rule }`.
7. If allowed, emit `FsCallEvent { kind: Request, allowed: true, ... }` through `ctx.fs_audit` and return the allowance so the caller can later emit `FsCallEvent::Result`.
8. If denied, emit `FsCallEvent { kind: Denied, allowed: false, ... }` and return `OrbitError::PolicyDenied("fs.<op> denied for <path> under fsProfile <profile> (matched rule <rule>)")`.

The audit emission goes through `ctx.fs_audit: Option<Arc<dyn FsAuditLogger>>` (`crates/orbit-tools/src/lib.rs`). The v2 dispatcher wires this to `v2_fs_audit_logger(audit.clone())`, which converts each `FsCallEvent` into a `V2AuditEvent` filesystem entry. The full audit-channel description belongs to [auditability](../auditability/2_design.md#3-tool-driven-and-runtime-audit-records); this folder owns the *enforcement* contract, not the storage contract.

`FsCallEvent` itself carries `{ kind, profile, op, path, allowed, matched_rule }`. There is no separately persisted negation flag — `allowed = false` is the only structural signal that a match was a deny. Consumers that need to distinguish "denied by an explicit deny rule" from "denied because no rule matched" must compare `matched_rule` against the policy's deny lists themselves.

The exec layer does not consult the policy engine at all. There is no `proc.spawn` policy gate today — exec is sandboxed only by what the calling tool has already validated and by the supervision contract in §8.

**Backend scope.** Tool-layer enforcement only fires when an activity runs under `backend: http` and reaches an Orbit fs builtin. `backend: cli` activities spawn an external CLI agent (Claude Code, Codex CLI, etc.) via `cli_runner.rs`; that path emits a `tool_allowlist.harness_delegated` envelope event and trusts the harness for tool allowlist behavior. On macOS, executors that declare `sandbox: macos-sandbox-exec` are additionally wrapped by the OS-level profile described in §7, so `fsProfile:` narrows CLI filesystem writes even though no Orbit fs builtin runs inside that subprocess.

---

## 6. Activity / Job fsProfile Binding

The `fsProfile:` field on an activity flows through `crates/orbit-engine/src/activity_job/`:

- `dispatcher.rs` carries `fs_profile: Option<&str>` on `DispatchInput` and threads it into `run_activity_job_dispatch`, `run_loop_step_dispatch`, and `run_agent_loop_via_driver`.
- `job_executor.rs` reads `t.fs_profile.as_deref()` from the activity spec at the call site of every step type.
- `agent_loop_driver.rs` and `groundhog.rs` invoke `host.tool_context_for_activity(fs_profile, audit_logger)` to construct the `ToolContext` that fs builtins read from.

`crates/orbit-core/src/runtime/v2_host.rs::tool_context_for_activity` is the single materialization point:

```
fs_profile: Some(fs_profile.unwrap_or(UNRESTRICTED_FS_PROFILE).to_string())
```

This is the implicit-`unrestricted` rule from §2.2 in code form. Every dispatcher path that constructs a `ToolContext` for an activity reaches this line, so omitting `fsProfile:` always means "unrestricted within whatever the policy says about unrestricted" — never "no policy at all."

`crates/orbit-core/src/runtime/pipeline.rs` runs a different fallback for legacy pipeline contexts. If a `ToolContext` arrives without `fs_profile`, the pipeline calls `read_activity_fs_profile_from_env()`, which returns the value of `ORBIT_ACTIVITY_FS_PROFILE` or `None` if the variable is unset or empty. This is **not** equivalent to the v2 host's behavior: when the env var is unset, `ctx.fs_profile` stays `None`, and `enforce_fs_policy` returns `Ok(None)` so fs work proceeds unguarded. The pipeline path is documented here as a real gap rather than as a fallback that mirrors `unrestricted`. See [§9](#9-concerns--honest-limitations).

---

## 7. Sandbox / Exec Primitives

`orbit-exec` is the process-spawn layer. The public surface is in `crates/orbit-exec/src/lib.rs`:

- `ExecRequest { program, args, current_dir, timeout_ms, stdin_mode, environment_mode, debug }` — the request shape.
- `EnvironmentMode::Inherit` (default) or `ClearAndSet(Vec<(String, String)>)`. The `Debug` impl redacts values whose keys match `is_sensitive_env_name`, so debug-printed `ExecRequest` does not leak provider keys.
- `StdinMode::Inherit` / `Null` / `Bytes(Vec<u8>)`.
- `Sandbox` trait (`crates/orbit-exec/src/sandbox.rs`) with one method `validate(req) -> Result<()>`. The default `NoSandbox` always returns `Ok`.
- `run_process(req, sandbox) -> ExecutionResult`.

`run_process` orders the work as: `sandbox.validate` first, then `process::spawn` (`crates/orbit-exec/src/process.rs`), then `supervision::wait_with_optional_timeout`. Spawn applies `EnvironmentMode` (clear + set when requested), wires stdout/stderr to piped descriptors, and on Unix calls `command.process_group(0)` so the child becomes its own process-group leader. That single setting is what allows the cleanup layer to kill orphan subprocesses later.

`ExecutionResult { success, stdout, stderr, exit_code, duration_ms, output }` is the result shape (defined in `orbit-common`). The runner converts captured bytes via `String::from_utf8_lossy`, so non-UTF-8 output is preserved as replacement characters rather than failing the call.

The `Sandbox` trait is still the seam for `run_process` callers and its default impl remains `NoSandbox`. CLI-backed `agent_loop` invocations use a separate executor-level wrapper when the executor declares `sandbox: macos-sandbox-exec` (shipped in [T20260427-51]). The v2 host resolves the activity `fsProfile`, converts workspace-relative rules to absolute roots under the workspace, and the engine compiles those roots to SBPL just before spawning the provider CLI.

The compiled macOS profile denies by default, allows broad reads required by agent CLIs and system libraries, allows process/signal/ipc/network/sysctl/iokit operations, and allows writes to:

- scratch/cache roots (`/tmp`, `/private/tmp`, `/private/var/folders`, `/dev`, and `$HOME/Library/Caches`)
- `$HOME/.orbit`, so inherited `orbit mcp serve` and other Orbit subprocesses can persist audit/state
- the Codex state directory, resolved as `$CODEX_HOME` when set and `$HOME/.codex` otherwise ([T20260428-10])
- every positive `modify` root from the resolved profile
- Codex side-write roots from runtime provider config (the same roots passed as `--add-dir`, today workspace `.orbit` and global `.orbit`), appended after policy denies so workflow state remains writable under the outer sandbox ([T20260428-10])

Negated `read` / `modify` rules become explicit SBPL deny clauses after ordinary profile allows so they retain last-match-wins semantics. Simple path denials and `/**` subtree denials compile to `subpath`; non-subpath globs such as `**/*.env` compile to `regex` so they do not collapse into a repo-wide deny. Host-owned provider side roots are the explicit exception: Orbit appends those write roots after the policy-derived denials because the provider CLI and inherited Orbit subprocesses need the same workflow-state roots to be writable.

---

## 8. Process Supervision

`crates/orbit-exec/src/supervision/wait.rs::wait_with_optional_timeout` orchestrates child lifetime. The contract:

1. Spawn background threads to drain stdout and stderr (`spawn_stdout_drain`, `spawn_stderr_drain` from `tee.rs`). These prevent the child from blocking on a full pipe buffer, which is the canonical "stuck child" failure mode for naive subprocess code.
2. If `StdinMode::Bytes` is set, spawn an additional stdin-writer thread (`spawn_stdin_write`).
3. On Unix, install a `SignalHandlerGuard` that captures SIGINT and SIGTERM via `libc::sigaction`. The handler writes a single byte to a non-blocking pipe; the wait loop reads from that pipe to learn that a parent-side signal arrived.
4. Loop with `WAIT_POLL_INTERVAL = 100ms`, calling `child.wait_timeout(slice)`. The slice is the smaller of the poll interval and the remaining deadline.
5. When the child exits cleanly, call `kill_process_group(child.id())` to reap any orphan subprocesses still holding the pipe write ends, then join the reader threads.
6. When a parent-side signal arrives, call `terminate_process_group(child, signal, poll_interval)` and report `exit_code = Some(128 + signal)` with a `process interrupted by signal SIG…` line appended to stderr.
7. When the deadline expires, call `terminate_process_group(child, SIGTERM, poll_interval)` and append `process timed out` to stderr.

`crates/orbit-exec/src/supervision/cleanup.rs` is the termination layer. The escalation policy:

1. Send `SIGTERM` (or the supplied signal) to the entire process group via `killpg`.
2. Poll `process_group_is_alive(pid)` for up to `TERMINATION_GRACE_PERIOD = 5 seconds`.
3. If the group is gone, return success.
4. Otherwise send `SIGKILL` to the group, then call `child.kill()` and `child.wait()` to reap.

`process_group_is_alive` uses `killpg(pid, 0)` and treats `ESRCH` as "all gone." Any other errno is treated as "still alive" so we err on the side of escalating to SIGKILL.

`crates/orbit-exec/src/supervision/signal.rs::SignalHandlerGuard` is an RAII guard. Install acquires a global `Mutex` (so only one wait loop installs handlers at a time), creates a non-blocking pipe, swaps in the orbit-exec handler for SIGINT and SIGTERM, and remembers the previous `sigaction` structs. Drop reverses every step in order — restore previous handlers, close the pipe, release the mutex. The handler itself is `unsafe extern "C"` and only does an atomic load and a single-byte `write`, both of which are async-signal-safe.

Non-Unix builds use a fallback `terminate_process_group` that just calls `child.kill().ok(); child.wait().ok();` — process-group semantics do not apply on Windows, so orphan reaping is best-effort.

## 9. Concerns & Honest Limitations

1. **OS-level CLI sandboxing is macOS-only.** `backend: cli` executors can be wrapped by `sandbox-exec` on macOS. Linux (`bwrap`), Docker, and other sandbox implementations remain future work, and non-agent `run_process` callers still use the `Sandbox` trait's `NoSandbox` default unless they add their own guard.
2. **Tool allowlists are still delegated for CLI backends.** The macOS wrapper narrows filesystem writes, but Orbit still does not enforce declared `tools:` inside Claude/Codex/Gemini CLI harnesses. The `tool_allowlist.harness_delegated` event remains the audit signal for that gap.
3. **Provider state directories are trusted write roots.** `$HOME/.orbit` and the Codex state directory are allowed so the provider and inherited Orbit subprocesses can initialize and persist state. Those allowances are intentionally narrow, but they are outside the activity workspace.
4. **Codex side-root appends are config-coupled.** The extra workspace/global `.orbit` side roots come from Codex `writable_dirs_json`, which Orbit currently populates for the default `execution.codex.sandbox = "workspace-write"` mode. If an operator configures Codex itself to `danger-full-access` while keeping the outer `macos-sandbox-exec` wrapper, those side roots are absent and inherited Orbit subprocesses may again hit workspace `.orbit` write denials.
5. **macOS provenance syscall allowances are private.** The `vnguard` and `Sandbox`/67 MAC-syscall allowances mirror Codex's own seatbelt profile and unblock current macOS startup behavior. They are Apple-internal details; if Codex startup returns a bare `Operation not permitted` after an OS update, inspect those clauses first.
6. **Pipeline env-fallback can leave `fs_profile = None`.** `crates/orbit-core/src/runtime/pipeline.rs` reads `ORBIT_ACTIVITY_FS_PROFILE` to fill a missing `fs_profile`. If the env var is unset, the `ToolContext` keeps `fs_profile: None`, `enforce_fs_policy` returns `Ok(None)`, and fs work proceeds unguarded. This diverges from the v2 host's `tool_context_for_activity`, which always materializes `unrestricted`. Callers that construct contexts outside the v2 dispatcher must set `fs_profile` explicitly or accept the unguarded path.
7. **Policy enforcement is not centralized within HTTP-backed runs either.** `enforce_fs_policy` is called from `orbit-tools::builtin::fs`, but a future tool (or a non-builtin tool) that performs fs work without going through that helper would not be guarded. There is no fs-trait-level policy interception.
8. **Exec has no policy hook.** `proc.spawn` and similar shell-invoking tools do not consult the `PolicyEngine`. Program allowlists are recorded at the activity layer (`activity.rs` notes that `spec.allowed_programs` is consulted by the proc.spawn tool), but those allowlists are not part of the `PolicyDef` and do not flow through `effective_profile`.
9. **Symlink semantics are not specified.** `workspace_relative_path` canonicalizes via `Path::canonicalize`, which follows symlinks and rejects out-of-workspace targets. The deny semantics for a symlink that points outside the workspace are "denied because the resolved path is not workspace-relative," but this is not currently spelled out as an invariant.
10. **Glob translator is narrow.** It supports `*`, `**`, `?`, and `<prefix>/**`. It does not support character classes (`[abc]`), brace expansion (`{a,b}`), or POSIX bracket expressions. New profile shapes that need richer matching will hit translator gaps before they hit the evaluator.
11. **`PolicyDecision` and `FsPolicyEvaluation` are parallel surfaces.** The fs path uses the evaluation struct; the broader RBAC plumbing uses the simple Allow/Deny enum. There is no current bridge that converts one to the other, which means future non-fs policy evaluators have to pick a return shape rather than reuse one.
12. **Empty-rule-set semantics are conservative but non-obvious.** A profile with no `read` rules denies every read with `matched_rule = "[]"`. This is the safe default, but a user who declares a profile with only `denyRead` rules and no positive rules will see "[]" denials, not the "matched the deny rule" denial they may expect.
13. **Signal handler installation is process-global.** `SignalHandlerGuard` uses a global `Mutex` to serialize installs, so two concurrent `run_process` calls in the same process must take turns installing handlers. This is currently fine because v2 dispatch is single-threaded per process, but it is a real constraint if exec ever moves into a worker pool.
14. **Workspace canonicalization can deny legitimate paths.** If `workspace_root.canonicalize()` fails (e.g., the directory was just deleted), the helper falls back to the non-canonical root, which can cause `strip_prefix` to fail and surface as a `PolicyDenied("path is outside workspace")` error rather than a clearer "workspace missing" error.
