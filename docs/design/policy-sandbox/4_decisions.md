## ADR-001 — Dedicated policy & sandboxing design ownership

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-04 · [T20260426-0622]

**Context.** Policy and sandboxing semantics were spread across `orbit-policy`, `orbit-exec`, the `PolicyDef` schema in `orbit-common`, the activity dispatcher, and the v2 host. There was no canonical place to record invariants, the `unrestricted` fallback, or the supervision contract.

**Decision.** Create `docs/design/policy-sandbox/` as the canonical design folder, with claude as owner. Auditability owns the recording of denials; this folder owns the *semantics* of allow/deny and the *contract* for how spawned processes are supervised.

**Consequences.**
- Policy and sandboxing decisions now have one ADR log and one glossary.
- Future enforcement work can cite a feature-owned spec rather than re-deriving rules from code.
- Cost: this folder cross-links into auditability and activity-job, so when those folders change their cross-references must be kept in sync rather than this folder absorbing them.

## ADR-002 — Policy schema is v2-only with named profiles plus global denies

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-04 · [T20260416-0728]

**Context.** An earlier policy schema (v1) used a different shape for allow/deny rules. Supporting both shapes in the runtime caused interpretation drift between the loader, the merger, and the evaluator.

**Decision.** Reject `schemaVersion: 1` at load time with an explicit migration message. v2 declares `denyRead`, `denyModify`, and `fsProfiles` and is the only accepted shape. Workspace policies override globals by profile name; global denies accumulate.

**Consequences.**
- Schema parsing has one supported branch.
- Profile authoring becomes uniform: a profile is always a `{ read, modify }` declaration; denies are always global.
- Cost: existing v1 policy files require a manual migration; there is no automatic upgrader.

## ADR-003 — Implicit `unrestricted` profile materializes when an activity omits `fsProfile:`

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-04 · [T20260419-0503]

**Context.** Activities can omit `fsProfile:`. A naive design would either reject the activity at load or run it without policy enforcement. Both are wrong: rejection breaks the common case, and unguarded execution means audit blindness.

**Decision.** When an activity omits `fsProfile:`, the v2 host substitutes the constant `UNRESTRICTED_FS_PROFILE` ("unrestricted") at `tool_context_for_activity`. If the policy does not define a profile of that name, the resolver synthesizes `read: ["./**"]` and `modify: ["./**"]`. Global `denyRead` / `denyModify` rules still apply because they are injected after profile resolution.

**Consequences.**
- "Unrestricted" is the default, but it is still narrowed by global denies.
- Policy authors can shadow the implicit fallback by declaring a profile named `unrestricted`, which is the supported way to narrow the default.
- Audit emission still happens for unrestricted activities, so there is no silent unguarded path.
- Cost: the word "unrestricted" carries different meaning depending on whether the policy defines a profile of that name, which is a learnable but real source of confusion.

## ADR-004 — Deny rules inject as negated profile rules with last-match-wins evaluation

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-04 · [T20260416-0728]

**Context.** A separate "deny pass" before profile evaluation is the obvious shape, but it makes precedence ambiguous when a profile rule and a deny rule both match. Multiple Orbit features (workspace overrides, profile narrowing, denyModify-also-implies-denyRead-for-modify validation) need a single evaluation order.

**Decision.** `effective_profile` appends every entry of `denyRead` to the profile's `read` list as `!<rule>` and every entry of `denyModify` to the profile's `modify` list as `!<rule>`. `check_path` walks the resolved list in order and the **last match wins**. There is no separate deny pass.

**Consequences.**
- Profile rules and deny rules are evaluated in one pass against one list.
- Deny ordering is deterministic: denies are appended after profile rules, so they always win against an earlier positive match for the same path.
- Cost: a profile author cannot re-allow a globally denied path by ordering, which is the intended safety property but surprises authors who expect a simple allowlist with overrides.

## ADR-005 — Modify rules must be covered by a read rule in the same profile

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-04 · [T20260416-0728]

**Context.** A profile that grants `modify: ["./build/**"]` without granting `read: ["./build/**"]` is technically valid but produces a confusing operational story: a tool may be allowed to write a file it cannot read, breaking the standard read-modify-write pattern.

**Decision.** `PolicyDef::validate` rejects any profile whose positive `modify` rule is not covered by a positive `read` rule in the same profile. "Covered" is checked structurally (`rule_covers_path_rule`): exact match, `**`, or a `<prefix>/**` rule that prefixes the modify rule.

**Consequences.**
- Modify rules cannot exist without a corresponding read rule.
- The audit story is consistent: every modify implies a prior allowed read for the same path.
- Cost: profile authors who *only* want to allow append-style writes cannot express that without granting a read rule. There is no "write-only" profile shape today.

## ADR-006 — Tool layer is the policy enforcement point for HTTP-backed activities

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-04 · [T20260419-0503]

**Context.** Policy enforcement could plausibly live at the syscall layer, the fs trait layer, the tool layer, or the activity layer. Each placement has different trust and coverage tradeoffs.

**Decision.** Enforcement lives in `orbit-tools::builtin::fs::enforce_fs_policy`. Every fs builtin calls it before the underlying read or modify, and emits `FsCallEvent` through `FsAuditLogger`. The `Sandbox` trait in `orbit-exec` does not consult the policy engine; exec is supervised but not policy-gated. This applies only to `backend: http` activities — `backend: cli` runs spawn an external CLI agent and emit a `tool_allowlist.harness_delegated` event in lieu of enforcement.

**Consequences.**
- HTTP-backed activities have a single, auditable enforcement seam.
- Tool authors are responsible for routing fs work through the helper. The contract is small, but it is a discipline rather than a structural invariant.
- The audit story has one shape — every HTTP-backed fs decision flows through one helper that emits one event family.
- Cost: CLI-backed activities are entirely unenforced by Orbit; a future tool (or a non-builtin tool inside HTTP) that performs fs work without using the helper is also unguarded. Both gaps are named in [2_design.md §9](./2_design.md#9-concerns--honest-limitations); closing them likely requires a `PolicyAwareFs` trait, an OS-level sandbox under CLI runtimes, or both.

## ADR-007 — Children spawn as process-group leaders so orphan subprocesses are reapable

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-04 · [T20260417-0558-4], [T20260328-221810]

**Context.** Naive subprocess code on Unix leaves orphan grandchildren holding open pipe write ends, which causes the parent's `wait_with_output` to hang when the orphan never exits. Earlier versions of orbit-exec hit this exact failure when an agent's tool spawned long-lived helpers.

**Decision.** On Unix, every spawned child calls `command.process_group(0)` so the child becomes a process-group leader (PGID = PID). The supervision layer kills the entire group via `killpg` when the child exits, when the parent receives SIGINT/SIGTERM, or when the deadline expires.

**Consequences.**
- Orphan subprocesses are reaped, so `wait_with_output` no longer hangs.
- Signal handling can target the whole tree with one syscall.
- Cost: tools that intentionally fork detached helpers (e.g., long-running daemons) cannot do so under orbit-exec without explicitly creating their own process group inside the child.

## ADR-008 — SIGTERM with 5-second grace, then SIGKILL for the whole group

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-04 · [T20260417-0558-4]

**Context.** A timed-out or interrupted child needs a chance to flush state before being killed, but the supervisor cannot wait indefinitely. The escalation policy needs a single, predictable shape.

**Decision.** `terminate_process_group` sends `SIGTERM` (or the supplied signal) to the group, polls `process_group_is_alive` for `TERMINATION_GRACE_PERIOD = 5 seconds`, and on expiry sends `SIGKILL` to the group plus a direct `child.kill()`/`child.wait()`. stderr is annotated with `process timed out` (deadline path) or `process interrupted by signal SIG…` (parent-signal path).

**Consequences.**
- Termination is deterministic: at most 5 seconds between intent and SIGKILL.
- The annotated stderr lets audit consumers distinguish timeout vs. signal vs. clean exit without reading the exit code alone.
- Cost: the 5-second constant is global. Activities that need a longer drain (database flush, large I/O cleanup) cannot extend it without code changes.

## ADR-009 — Signal handler installation is process-global and serialized

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-04 · [T20260417-0558-5]

**Context.** Installing parent-side SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers is a process-global operation. Two concurrent `run_process` calls cannot install independent handlers without races, and a panicking call must restore the prior handler so the orbit process itself remains interruptible.

**Decision.** `SignalHandlerGuard::install` acquires a `Mutex` from a `OnceLock`, creates a non-blocking pipe, calls `libc::sigaction` for SIGINT and SIGTERM, and stores the previous `sigaction` structs. Drop reverses the steps: restore previous handlers, close the pipe, release the mutex. The handler itself is async-signal-safe (atomic load + 1-byte `write`).

**Consequences.**
- Concurrent `run_process` calls in the same process serialize on the mutex during install/drop, but the wait loops themselves run concurrently.
- A panic inside a wait loop still restores prior handlers via Drop.
- Cost: contention on the global mutex limits exec parallelism in a single process. Named as an open question in [3_vision.md §1.11](./3_vision.md#1-open-questions).

## ADR-010 — `NoSandbox` is the default `Sandbox` impl; real isolation is deferred

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-04 · [T20260417-0550]

**Context.** The `Sandbox` trait is the seam where kernel-level or container-level isolation would attach to `orbit-exec`. The trait shipped with the supervision rework, but no real impl is registered.

**Decision.** Ship `NoSandbox` as the default and only implementation. Defer kernel-level isolation (bubblewrap, sandbox-exec, container, seccomp) until policy enforcement at the tool layer is judged insufficient and the platform-coverage cost is understood. The trait surface is stable so a future impl can attach without changing the runner.

**Consequences.**
- The trait surface is stable for a future impl to attach to.
- Today's safety story is "policy at the tool layer" — explicit and documented, but not OS-enforced.
- Cost: a tool that performs fs work without `enforce_fs_policy` (or a future non-builtin tool) has no exec-level isolation backstop. This is the structural reason §1.1 of [3_vision.md](./3_vision.md) lists real sandboxing as the top open question.

## ADR-011 — `sandbox-exec` wraps cli-backend agent invocations on macOS

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-04 · [T20260427-51]

**Context.** ADR-006 carved CLI backends out of the policy enforcement seam: `tool_allowlist.harness_delegated` is emitted, but the agent's built-in tools (`claude` `Edit` / `Write` / `Bash`, `codex`'s tools, `gemini`'s tools) execute under the orbit process's filesystem rights. Each agent CLI ships its own native isolation primitive — codex `--sandbox`, gemini `-s`, claude nothing — so the architecture's stated "`orbit-exec` owns sandboxing under an `FsProfile`" guarantee was honored asymmetrically and not honored at all for claude. A prompt-injected claude in a worktree could `Bash(rm -rf ...)` outside its declared `fsProfile` and orbit had no answer.

**Decision.** Build `orbit-exec::macos_sandbox` as the single declarative seam: compile a `ResolvedFsProfile` to SBPL and wrap the cli invocation in `sandbox-exec -f <profile>`. Apply uniformly to claude, codex, and gemini via a new `spec.sandbox: macos-sandbox-exec` knob on the executor YAML. When orbit-exec is authoritative, neutralize each cli's native sandbox flag (codex pinned to `--sandbox danger-full-access`, gemini's `-s` / `--sandbox` dropped) so the same constraint isn't double-encoded. Default `allow_fallback: false` (fail-closed when `sandbox-exec` is missing). Layering inner CLI flags alongside the outer sandbox (defense-in-depth) is deferred — v1 picks "one source of truth" first.

The sandbox descriptor is resolved by orbit-core's `V2RuntimeHost::resolve_executor_sandbox` and compiled to SBPL by orbit-engine just before spawn. orbit-core has no direct edge to orbit-exec; orbit-engine already imports orbit-exec, so SBPL compilation lives close to the spawn site.

**Consequences.**
- claude now has OS-enforced filesystem narrowing under macOS — not just in-process gates.
- All three providers share one declarative source of truth (`FsProfile` → SBPL via orbit-exec); operators read one rule set, not three CLI-specific syntaxes.
- The `allow_fallback` knob lets operators degrade gracefully when `sandbox-exec` is unavailable, but the safe default is fail-closed.
- Linux (`bwrap`), Docker, network restriction, and activity-level sandbox overrides are explicitly out of scope for v1; the `ExecutorSandboxKind` enum and orbit-exec module layout leave room for `linux-bwrap` to land alongside.
- SBPL is Apple-deprecated-but-still-shipping (codex itself uses it). v1 accepts that risk.
- Cost: SBPL writes are static text; complex `denyRead` / `denyModify` rule combinations don't always translate cleanly. Simple subtree denials use `subpath`; non-subpath deny globs use SBPL `regex` to avoid over-denying the containing directory. Activities that need precise allow-side glob semantics under sandbox should declare profiles with explicit subpath roots.

## ADR-012 — Codex state and side roots are narrow sandbox write allowances

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-04 · [T20260428-10]

**Context.** After workflow admission was fixed in [T20260428-8], `orbit run ship T20260428-5` reached the Codex-backed `agent_implement` step, but Codex exited during startup under `sandbox-exec` with `Operation not permitted`. The outer profile allowed task worktree writes, temp/cache writes, and `$HOME/.orbit`, but not Codex's own state directory. Codex initializes state before it reads Orbit's envelope, so the provider could not start. Once Codex state was allowed, the same run still failed because the default policy's workspace `.orbit/**` write deny overrode the Codex `--add-dir` side root that Orbit passed for workflow state, and because the `**/*.env` deny glob collapsed to a repo-wide `subpath` deny.

**Decision.** Keep `sandbox-exec` as the filesystem authority and add two narrow Codex allowances. First, allow provider state writes to `$CODEX_HOME` when set, otherwise `$HOME/.codex`. Second, append Codex side-write roots from runtime provider config (the same roots passed as `--add-dir`, today workspace `.orbit` and global `.orbit`) after policy-derived denials. Compile non-subpath deny globs such as `**/*.env` as SBPL `regex` clauses instead of reducing them to their containing directory. Do not grant broad `$HOME` writes and do not disable the outer sandbox.

**Consequences.**
- Codex-backed `backend: cli` runs can initialize under the macOS sandbox while project writes remain constrained by the resolved `fsProfile`.
- Operators can relocate Codex state with `CODEX_HOME`, and the compiled profile follows that location.
- Inherited Orbit subprocesses can persist workflow lifecycle state under the same side roots Codex receives as CLI arguments.
- Cost: the Codex state directory and provider side roots are trusted writable state outside ordinary project-content policy, similar to the existing `$HOME/.orbit` allowance for inherited Orbit subprocesses.
