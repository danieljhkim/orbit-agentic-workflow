# Spec: Filesystem Profile Resolution

`PolicyDef::effective_profile` and `PolicyDef::check_path` are the load-bearing functions for every filesystem allow/deny decision in Orbit. This spec names the invariants those functions must preserve and the failure modes callers must handle.

## Why This Exists

The resolution algorithm has multiple layered transformations (lookup, normalization, deny injection, last-match-wins evaluation) and a special-case fallback for the implicit `unrestricted` profile. Without a prescriptive spec, future changes to any one layer can break a property that another layer relies on.

## Resolution Invariants

- **Schema acceptance.** Only `schemaVersion: 2` policies are accepted. v1 is rejected at load time with an explicit migration message that names `spec.denyRead`, `spec.denyModify`, and `spec.fsProfiles`.
- **Profile lookup.** `effective_profile(profile_name)` returns the named profile if present. If absent and `profile_name == "unrestricted"`, it synthesizes `FsProfile { read: ["./**"], modify: ["./**"] }`. Any other absent name returns `OrbitError::InvalidInput`.
- **Rule normalization.** Every rule is trimmed, has backslashes converted to forward slashes, has leading `./` stripped, and is rejected if it contains `~`, `~/`, parent traversals, or absolute paths. The normalizer also compiles the rule to its glob-equivalent regex; a rule that fails to compile is rejected at load.
- **Deny injection.** Every entry of `denyRead` is appended to the resolved profile's `read` list as `!<rule>`; every entry of `denyModify` is appended to the resolved profile's `modify` list as `!<rule>`. Injection happens after profile lookup so the implicit `unrestricted` profile is also subject to global denies.
- **Validation invariants.**
  - Profile names are non-empty.
  - A positive `modify` rule is covered by at least one positive `read` rule in the same profile (`rule_covers_path_rule`).
  - A profile rule that exactly equals a global `denyRead` or `denyModify` entry is rejected.
  - `denyRead` rules are also treated as `denyModify` for the validation cross-check: a profile cannot grant modify on a path that is globally read-denied.
- **Merge contract.** `PolicyDef::merged(global, workspace)` overrides global `fsProfiles` by name with workspace entries, accumulates global `denyRead` / `denyModify` with workspace additions (deduplicated), prefers the workspace description when set, and re-runs `validate` on the merged result.

## Evaluation Invariants

- **Path normalization.** Caller-supplied paths are normalized via `normalize_path`: trim, slash-flip, strip leading `./`. Absolute paths, `~`-anchored paths, and parent-directory components are rejected after backslash normalization.
- **Empty rule list.** If the operation's rule list is empty after deny injection, the decision is `allowed = false` with `matched_rule = "[]"`.
- **Rule walk.** The evaluator walks the rule list in order and tracks the most recent match. The decision uses the *last* match's negation flag: positive match → allow, negated match → deny.
- **Empty positive set.** If the rule list contains no positive rules (only negated rules), the decision is `allowed = false` with `matched_rule = "[]"`.
- **No matching rule.** If positive rules exist but none match, the decision is `allowed = false` with `matched_rule = "<no matching rule>"`.
- **Matched-rule reporting.** A positive match reports the original rule string in `matched_rule`. A negated match reports the inner pattern (without the leading `!`) and surfaces as `allowed = false`. There is no separately persisted negation flag on `FsCheckResult`, `FsPolicyEvaluation`, or `FsCallEvent` — the only structural signal that a match was a deny is the `allowed = false` value. Audit consumers that need to distinguish "denied by an explicit deny rule" from "denied because no rule matched" must inspect `matched_rule` against the policy's deny lists themselves.

## Glob Translator

- **Supported syntax:** `*` (single-segment wildcard, anchored to `[^/]*`), `**` (cross-segment wildcard, anchored to `.*`), `**/` segment (anchored to `(?:.*/)?`), `?` (single character within a segment, anchored to `[^/]`), `<prefix>/**` directory-subtree match (anchored to `^<prefix>(?:/.*)?$`).
- **Unsupported syntax:** character classes (`[abc]`), brace expansion (`{a,b}`), POSIX bracket expressions, leading `**/` followed by another `**`, escape sequences. Rules that need these will hit translator gaps before they hit the evaluator.
- **Anchoring.** Compiled regexes are anchored at both ends (`^…$`). Partial matches do not satisfy a rule.

## Failure Modes

- **Profile missing.** `effective_profile("unknown")` (where the policy does not define `unknown` and the name is not `unrestricted`) returns `OrbitError::InvalidInput`. Callers must treat this as a configuration error, not a deny.
- **Rule normalization failure.** A rule that escapes the workspace, is empty, or fails to compile to a regex returns `OrbitError::InvalidInput` at validation or resolution time. Loaders must surface this to the user; runtimes must treat it as a stop-the-world error rather than falling back to deny-all.
- **Workspace canonicalization failure.** The tool layer's `workspace_relative_path` falls back to the non-canonical workspace root when `canonicalize` fails. A path that cannot be expressed workspace-relative surfaces as `OrbitError::PolicyDenied("path is outside workspace")`, which is conservative but does not distinguish "workspace deleted" from "path actually outside."
- **Empty `read` rule list.** A profile authored without read rules denies every read with `matched_rule = "[]"`. This is almost always a misconfiguration but is treated as a valid (if useless) profile.

## Migration Rules

- New profile fields must extend `FsProfile` and `ResolvedFsProfile` together; the resolver and the validator both consume `ResolvedFsProfile`.
- New deny categories (e.g., `denyExec`) must be injected as negated rules into a corresponding rule list rather than evaluated as a separate pass; this preserves the single-walk evaluation contract.
- Schema version bumps must reject the previous version explicitly at load and name the migration in the error message, the same way v1 → v2 currently does.
