# Task Artifacts Execution Plan

**Status:** Draft
**Owner:** codex
**Last updated:** 2026-05-11

This is the temporary execution tracker for the task-artifacts reset until Orbit tasks can track this work again. It intentionally assumes a pre-release reset: existing task artifacts were deleted, no external users depend on the old layout, and the implementation does not need a migration command, legacy lookup aliases, or old-schema compatibility shims.

## Current Position

The design baseline is in place:

- `docs/design/task-artifacts/1_overview.md` defines the feature intent.
- `docs/design/task-artifacts/2_design.md` defines the target v2 layout.
- `docs/design/task-artifacts/specs/task-bundle-v2.md` defines the storage contract.
- `docs/design/task-artifacts/4_decisions.md` records the proposed ADRs.

Implementation has started. Phase 0 and Phase 1 are implemented in the working tree, pending review and commit. The next meaningful milestone is to make the home task registry and workspace binding real, then replace the current task store with the v2 bundle store.

## Non-Goals

- No `orbit migrate task-artifacts` command.
- No support for old `T<YYYYMMDD>-<N>` task IDs in v2 lookup paths.
- No old-to-new ID mapping report.
- No status-directory reader fallback.
- No embedded `description`, `acceptance_criteria`, `history`, `comments`, or `review_threads` compatibility inside v2 `task.yaml`.
- No dual-write mirror between `.orbit/tasks/` and `~/.orbit/tasks/`.

## Phase 0 - Prep And Guardrails

**Status:** Implemented in working tree

Goal: make the reset explicit in tests, docs, and compile-time surfaces before changing storage.

Work:

- Add v2 fixture examples for a minimal task, task with relations, task with comments, and task with review threads.
- Add tests that reject old task IDs and old task envelope fields in v2 code paths.
- Identify all code paths that currently assume status directories, date partitioning, or `T...` IDs.
- Decide whether `Task` remains the temporary public DTO during the cutover or whether a new v2-facing DTO lands first.
- Update design docs if implementation discovers a contract mismatch.

Exit criteria:

- Fixture set is present under `crates/orbit-common/tests/fixtures/task-artifacts-v2/`; commit pending.
- Search inventory exists for old-layout assumptions. Complete as of 2026-05-11.
- The implementation branch has passing guardrail tests for the intended v2 behavior.

### Phase 0 Inventory

Current old-layout assumptions are concentrated in these surfaces:

- `crates/orbit-store/src/file/task_store/layout.rs` owns status directories, terminal-month partitioning, `T<YYYYMMDD>-<N>` allocation, ID validation, path lookup, and legacy status-dir migration.
- `crates/orbit-store/src/file/task_store/api.rs` creates tasks through the old allocator, lists by scanning status directories, validates old IDs at public store entry points, and mutates the flat bundle in memory before rewriting.
- `crates/orbit-store/src/file/task_store/doc.rs` embeds `description`, `acceptance_criteria`, `history`, `comments`, `review_threads`, `workspace_path`, and `repo_root` inside `task.yaml`.
- `crates/orbit-store/src/file/task_store/bundle.rs` reconstructs the public `Task` DTO from `task.yaml`, `plan.md`, and `execution-summary.md`.
- `crates/orbit-store/src/file/task_store/lock.rs` still keys file locks by the old task ID validator.
- `crates/orbit-common/src/types/task.rs` remains the flat public DTO and still carries old embedded fields, legacy relation fields, workspace bindings, comments, history, and review threads.
- `crates/orbit-core/src/command/task/*`, `crates/orbit-tools/src/builtin/orbit/task/*`, and `crates/orbit-tools/src/builtin/orbit/review_thread/*` expose the flat task DTO and old field names at CLI/tool boundaries.
- `crates/orbit-store/src/sqlite/task_reservation_store.rs` and `crates/orbit-core/src/runtime/orbit_tool_host/task_locks.rs` are the current lock-reservation surfaces that Phase 4 must re-key to workspace binding plus canonical task IDs.

DTO decision for cutover: keep the existing `Task` as the runtime/API compatibility DTO until the v2 bundle store can project from the new artifact model. Add `TaskEnvelopeV2` and sidecar/log/thread/manifest types as storage-domain contracts first. This avoids forcing every CLI, MCP, engine, and web consumer to move before persistence exists, while still preventing new v2 code from accepting the old YAML envelope.

## Phase 1 - V2 Domain Types

**Status:** Implemented in working tree

Goal: define the storage model without touching persistence yet.

Work:

- Add `ORB-00000` validation and formatting helpers.
- Add `TaskEnvelopeV2` with `schema_version: 1`.
- Add `TaskRelation` and relation validation for type set, self-edges, duplicates, and blocking/hierarchy cycles.
- Add JSONL row structs for task events and comments.
- Add review-thread metadata structs with `schema_version: 1`.
- Add artifact manifest structs with checksum, media type, size, and blob path.
- Add document-name constants for `description`, `acceptance`, `plan`, and `execution-summary`.

Exit criteria:

- V2 structs serialize and deserialize to the documented shape.
- Unit tests cover ID validation, relation validation, schema-version presence, JSONL rows, and artifact path validation.
- No production command writes v2 bundles yet.

## Phase 2 - Home Registry And Workspace Binding

**Status:** Not started

Goal: make `~/.orbit/tasks/index.sqlite` and `.orbit/config.yaml` load-bearing.

Work:

- Add home task registry creation under `~/.orbit/tasks/index.sqlite`.
- Add allocator state with a machine-local monotonic `ORB-*` suffix.
- Add workspace bindings table with `workspace_id`, slug, repo root, workspace path, `.orbit` path, and optional fingerprints.
- Add `.orbit/config.yaml` read/write with `schema_version: 1` and `workspace_id`.
- Add workspace-id assignment as `<slug>-<6char>`.
- Add rebind detection for missing `.orbit/config.yaml`; ambiguous matches must prompt or error, not silently attach.
- Add projection rebuild support for `.orbit/tasks/<task-id>` symlinks.
- Define and implement the first degraded-mode behavior for symlink-restricted filesystems.

Exit criteria:

- A fresh checkout can initialize a workspace binding.
- Multiple local workspaces allocate from one local ID authority.
- Deleting `.orbit/tasks/` can be repaired from registry metadata.

## Phase 3 - V2 Bundle Store

**Status:** Not started

Goal: replace status-directory storage with canonical home bundles plus symlink projection.

Work:

- Introduce the v2 bundle abstraction around:
  - `task.yaml`
  - `description.md`
  - `acceptance.md`
  - `plan.md`
  - `execution-summary.md`
  - `events.jsonl`
  - `comments.jsonl`
  - `review-threads/`
  - `artifacts/`
- Write new tasks directly to `~/.orbit/tasks/workspaces/<workspace-id>/<task-id>/`.
- Create `.orbit/tasks/<task-id>` symlinks after canonical bundle creation succeeds.
- Implement atomic sidecar rewrite helpers.
- Implement JSONL append helpers with flush, file sync, and final-line tail-corruption recovery.
- Make list/get locate tasks through the registry and canonical paths rather than status-directory scans.
- Remove lifecycle directory moves; status changes update the envelope and append an event.

Exit criteria:

- `task add`, `task show`, `task list`, and basic status updates work on v2 bundles.
- No task operation requires status directories.
- A task bundle can be inspected manually and matches the spec.

## Phase 4 - Task Operations And Local Indexes

**Status:** Not started

Goal: restore the full task workflow on top of v2 storage.

Work:

- Update document updates to write Markdown sidecars.
- Update comments to append `comments.jsonl`.
- Update history/lifecycle writes to append `events.jsonl`.
- Update review-thread commands to write per-thread YAML plus Markdown bodies.
- Update artifact writes to use `artifacts/manifest.yaml` and `artifacts/files/`.
- Maintain generated indexes for status, terminal month, relations, and tags.
- Move task-lock keying to workspace binding plus canonical task IDs.
- Preserve lifecycle validation rules, including execution summary before review.

Exit criteria:

- Existing task CLI and tool-host workflows pass against v2 storage.
- Status and terminal listing ergonomics are restored through generated views.
- Relation queries do not scan every bundle.

## Phase 5 - Consumers And Search

**Status:** Not started

Goal: update readers outside the core task store.

Work:

- Update lexical search to index title, document sidecars, comments, review threads, external refs, and selected text artifacts.
- Update semantic search field names to v2 document names.
- Update web/API task JSON serialization to expose logical v2 fields.
- Update dashboard/status views to use generated indexes.
- Update task locks UI/output to show canonical `ORB-*` IDs.
- Update docs that still describe task sync over the old status-directory shape.

Exit criteria:

- CLI, MCP/tool-host JSON, and web API agree on task field names.
- Search returns snippets from the correct v2 field.
- No consumer depends on old task directory paths.

## Phase 6 - Remove Old Store Shape

**Status:** Not started

Goal: delete the old task artifact assumptions once v2 is working.

Work:

- Remove `T<YYYYMMDD>-<N>` allocation and validation from task code.
- Remove old status-directory layout code.
- Remove terminal month directory partitioning.
- Remove old YAML fields from task persistence.
- Remove legacy proposed/friction task migrations tied to old task bundles.
- Remove text-only artifact storage assumptions.
- Prune the transitional "current implementation" section from `2_design.md`.
- Flip task-artifacts ADRs from `Proposed` to `Accepted` when the implementation lands.

Exit criteria:

- `make fmt`, `make build`, and `make ci` pass.
- Repository docs describe the live implementation, not a target state.
- Task artifacts are usable enough that future work can be tracked in Orbit itself.

## Latest Validation

2026-05-11:

- `cargo fmt -p orbit-common`
- `cargo test -p orbit-common`

## Suggested First PR

Start with Phase 2 plus the smallest slice of Phase 1 needed to allocate and validate `ORB-*` IDs. That proves the global local allocator, workspace binding, and projection-repair story before the broad task-store rewrite begins.
