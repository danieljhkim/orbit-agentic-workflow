# Auditability — Vision

This document captures the questions that remain before Orbit's auditability story matches its product promise end to end. [2_design.md](./2_design.md) is the current implementation; this file names the pressure points that should drive future tasks and ADRs.

---

## 1. Open Questions

1. **Canonical query surface.** Should `orbit audit` stay command-row-only, or grow a run-centric view that joins command rows, job-run state, v2 envelopes, loop JSONL, blobs, and invocation metrics?
2. **Local tamper evidence.** Should Orbit use per-file hash chains, SQLite append proofs, signed manifests, git-backed checkpoints, or export-time attestations while staying self-hosted by default?
3. **Auditing audit reads.** Should `orbit audit` reads, exports, and prunes remain outside the guard to avoid recursion, or be recorded through a separate path?
4. **Stable identity key.** What joins human CLI usage, family-based tool inputs, task attribution fields, v2 `agent_identity`, invocation metrics, commits, and PR metadata?
5. **Stdout/stderr retention.** The command schema has truncated stdout/stderr fields, but most paths leave them empty. What retention policy should exist before broad capture?
6. **JSONL migration.** [T20260426-0519] moved run traces to `.orbit/state/audit/`; should old `.orbit/audit/` files be migrated, ignored, or read through a legacy fallback?
7. **Replay payload depth.** When are redacted verbatim prompts/responses required, and when are summaries enough?
8. **Uniform denials.** Can filesystem denials, tool allowlist denials, task-lock conflicts, and gate starvation share one audit shape?
9. **Coverage enforcement.** What lint or tests should fail review when a new mutation path lacks audit coverage?
10. **Metrics derivation.** Should invocation metrics stay primary records, or eventually derive from loop traces at the cost of tighter coupling?

## 2. Prior Work

### 2.1 Orbit-Internal

Activity / Job's audit-envelope section and ADRs in [../activity-job/2_design.md](../activity-job/2_design.md) and [../activity-job/4_decisions.md](../activity-job/4_decisions.md) document the v2 envelope, backend differences, CLI allowlist delegation, file-backed audit placement, and invocation trace persistence.

The product contract lives in [../../../README.md](../../../README.md) and [../../POSITIONING.md](../../POSITIONING.md): auditability should answer what, why, and who; audit rows should be structured and queryable; provider interactions should be reproducible after redaction; retention should become tamper-evident; and identity should attach to every write.

The redaction and blob-store implementation is the existing write-side safety boundary. Future query tools should preserve it even if they read blobs more directly.

### 2.2 Workflow and Observability Systems

Temporal and Airflow show the value of explicit run, step, retry, and state-transition history. OpenTelemetry shows the value of trace/span identifiers and exportable schemas. Orbit should borrow the join model while keeping accountability and replay obligations distinct from generic telemetry.

### 2.3 Supply-Chain Attestation

SLSA, in-toto, Sigstore, and Rekor point toward signed or transparency-backed provenance. Orbit can learn from those systems, but local/self-hosted operation must remain the default.

### 2.4 Security Event Logging

Security audit systems treat reads, writes, privilege decisions, and retention as one accountability surface. Orbit's domain is narrower, but a policy denial, task update, provider request, and PR operation should all be explainable from the audit trail.

---

## 3. What May Be Distinctive

1. **Code-aware audit joins.** Orbit can join records by run id, task id, context selector, lock reservation, worktree, graph node, and commit attribution.
2. **Agent identity as a first-class actor.** The trail can name humans, model families, provider backends, and task roles without treating agents as generic service accounts.
3. **Transcript plus structure.** V2 envelopes describe the workflow tree while loop blobs preserve redacted provider/tool payloads.
4. **Local tamper evidence.** A self-hosted team-scale runtime can produce verifiable local audit bundles without a hosted control plane.
5. **Coverage as a design gate.** New mutation paths should name their audit event family before they ship.
