# Knowledge Graph — Overview

**Status:** Draft
**Owner:** claude
**Last updated:** 2026-04-30

The knowledge graph is Orbit's durable, queryable codebase map: a content-addressed, branch-scoped tree of directories, files, and extracted symbols annotated with task history. It sits between raw files and the agent prompt so agents can ask *"where is `AgentRuntime` defined?"* or *"which symbols did task [T20260421-0528] touch?"* without re-reading the repo from scratch. This compaction pass [T20260430-22] keeps the overview focused on entry-point concepts and leaves mechanism detail to [2_design.md](./2_design.md).

This document is the entry point. [2_design.md](./2_design.md) specifies the current implementation in detail; [3_vision.md](./3_vision.md) captures open questions and direction.

## 1. Motivation

Unassisted agents mostly navigate with `grep`, `find`, and full-file reads. Each has a sharp edge:

1. **Grep is string-level.** It mixes call sites, comments, fields, and unrelated names.
2. **Full-file reads bloat context.** A 30-line answer often arrives wrapped in hundreds of irrelevant lines.
3. **Cold sessions forget structure.** Module layout, trait hierarchies, and import graphs get re-derived every turn.

An LSP solves #1 and parts of #2 but is hostile to agent loops: it is stateful, process-local, and returns results tuned for IDE UX (hover text, rename previews) rather than for token-efficient prompt assembly.

The graph precomputes that structure once per branch, persists it, and exposes prompt-shaped query tools.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Node types

The graph has three node kinds:

- **`DirNode`** — a directory with child dirs/files; the root id derives from `"."`.
- **`FileNode`** — a source file with extracted leaves plus a `source_blob_hash`.
- **`LeafNode`** — an extracted symbol or doc/config/table leaf with source span, hash, signature fields, and history.

All three share `BaseNodeFields`: `id`, `identity_key`, `location`, `language`, `description`, `parent_id`, lock state, and a sorted, deduplicated `task_ids` list attributed from commit history ([T20260421-0528]).

The rename from `leaf` to `symbol` at the tool surface happened under [T20260411-0424]; the in-code type is still `LeafNode` because the internal vocabulary predates that decision and the rename has not yet reached the type name.

### 2.2 Identity vs. hash

Every node has three independent keys with different stability properties:

| Key | Role | Stability |
|-----|------|-----------|
| `id` | Primary reference within a graph snapshot | Stable across rebuilds of the same repo state |
| `identity_key` | Cross-build lineage used by the working graph to track renames and re-identification | Stable across rebuilds |
| `object_hash` | Content hash of the serialized node | Changes whenever any field changes |

Ids are derived from kind + location + discriminator. Object hashes drive deduplication in the object store.

### 2.3 Refs, indexes, and objects

Storage follows a git-style split:

```
.orbit/knowledge/graph/
├── objects/<hh>/<hash>.json     immutable, content-addressed node bodies
├── blobs/<hh>/<hash>.txt        immutable, content-addressed file/symbol source
├── index/by-id/<root-graph-hash>.json   immutable per-build index
└── refs/heads/<branch>.json     mutable branch ref → active index
```

A rebuild writes new immutable objects/blobs and index, then atomically swings the branch ref. Refs are the only mutable surface, so concurrent builds on different worktrees cannot corrupt each other ([T20260421-0358]). See [specs/refs.md](./specs/refs.md).

### 2.4 Working graph and write guards

The current public graph surface is read-only. Agents use it to inspect, search, and pack context, while write coordination happens before dispatch through task `context_files` and `orbit.task.locks.reserve` preflight guards. Those guards operate at the workspace/task plane rather than inside a branch-local graph ref, which keeps them meaningful when agents work in separate worktrees.

The in-memory **working graph** (`crates/orbit-knowledge/src/working_graph`) remains an internal/deferred mutation substrate. Public graph write tools are absent because branch-local graph locks do not coordinate independent worktrees.

### 2.5 Attribution

Each node carries a `task_ids` list. These are populated by the history-walker stage (`pipeline::history`, introduced in [T20260421-0528]) which parses `\[T\d{8}-\d+(?:-\d+)*\]` tags out of commit messages, maps hunks to symbols at the commit's tree, and accumulates the result onto the current graph. A merge commit where both sides touched the same symbol sets `structural_conflict: true` — informational only; git already resolved the textual conflict.
