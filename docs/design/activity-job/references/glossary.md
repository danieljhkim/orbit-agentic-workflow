# Glossary: Activity / Job

This glossary covers Orbit-specific execution-substrate vocabulary used by the Activity / Job docs. It deliberately excludes generic workflow terms such as "retry," "quorum," and "timeout" unless Orbit gives them a more specific meaning.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **ActivityV2** | The typed `schemaVersion: 2` activity shape: shared metadata plus one concrete runtime variant. See [../2_design.md §2](../2_design.md). |
| **Backend::Auto** | Authoring-time backend marker that orbit-core resolves to a concrete backend once per run. It must not survive into dispatch. See [../2_design.md §5](../2_design.md). |
| **TargetRef** | Authoring-facing `target: activity:<name>` form in a job step. It is resolved to a concrete `TargetStep` before execution. See [../2_design.md §3](../2_design.md). |
| **ToolAllowlistHarnessDelegated** | Advisory envelope event emitted on the CLI backend to say Orbit passed the declared `tools:` list through to the provider harness instead of enforcing it locally. See [../2_design.md §7.2](../2_design.md). |
| **V2AuditEnvelope** | Structured audit wrapper carrying run/step/activity provenance for the v2 runtime. See [../specs/audit-envelope.md](../specs/audit-envelope.md). |
| **V2RuntimeHost** | The orbit-core to orbit-engine boundary trait that supplies deterministic actions, provider credentials, CLI command resolution, and `ToolContext`. See [../2_design.md §6](../2_design.md). |
| **Workspace Path Provenance** | The absolute repo path attached to envelope events so the shared audit trail can be filtered by originating workspace. See [../specs/audit-envelope.md](../specs/audit-envelope.md). |
