# Activity / Job — Design

**Status:** Draft
**Owner:** codex
**Last updated:** 2026-04-30

This document describes the shipped Activity / Job substrate as it exists today across `orbit-common`, `orbit-engine`, `orbit-core`, and `orbit-cli`: asset shape, load-time normalization, dispatch boundaries, backend semantics, DAG execution, audit, and the legacy edges that still matter. See [1_overview.md](./1_overview.md) for the feature's purpose and [3_vision.md](./3_vision.md) for forward-looking questions.

---

## 1. Asset Shape and Two-Pass Loading

Activity / Job assets are `schemaVersion: 2` YAML envelopes with:

- `kind: Activity` or `kind: Job`
- `metadata.name`
- typed `spec`

The loader in `crates/orbit-common/src/types/activity_job/asset_loader.rs` reads the schema header first, then parses the full envelope into `ActivityV2` or `JobV2`. That two-pass shape arrived with the first v2 activity runtime scaffolding in [T20260418-2010].

The important current contract is that `schemaVersion: 1` is not "legacy but tolerated." It is retired. The loader returns a structural error for version 1 after [T20260419-2156]. `kind` mismatches are also structural errors, so an activity file can never accidentally dispatch as a job or vice versa.

---

## 2. Activity Surface

`ActivityV2` carries shared fields:

- `description`
- `input_schema_json`
- `output_schema_json`
- optional `fsProfile`

and then flattens one `ActivityV2Spec` variant:

- `AgentLoop(AgentLoopSpec)`
- `Groundhog(GroundhogSpec)`
- `Deterministic(DeterministicSpec)`
- `Shell(ShellSpec)`

The common `agent_loop` fields are:

- `instruction`
- `tools`
- `on_denial`
- optional `model`
- `max_iterations`
- `backend`
- `provider`
- `wall_clock_timeout_seconds`

Groundhog intentionally does not reuse the exact serialized `AgentLoopSpec` shape. It has its own `GroundhogSpec`, but `as_agent_loop_spec()` projects it into an HTTP-backed agent loop when the runner needs the shared transport path. That sibling activity kind landed in [T20260420-0510-2].

`DeterministicSpec` is just `{ action, config }`. `ShellSpec` is a direct subprocess surface with `program`, `args`, `allowed_programs`, `timeout_seconds`, and `expected_exit_codes`.

---

## 3. Job Surface

`JobV2` carries:

- `state`
- optional `default_input`
- `max_active_runs`
- `kind`
- `steps`

`JobKind` is currently `workflow` or `subroutine`, added in [T20260419-0339]. The more interesting surface is the step grammar from [T20260418-2018]:

- every step has `id`
- every step may add `when`
- every step may add `retry`
- every step chooses exactly one body

The body is one of:

- flat `TargetStep`
- named `TargetRef`
- `parallel`
- `fan_out` plus matching `fan_in`
- `loop`

`TargetStep` is the executor-facing form. It inlines an `ActivityV2Spec` plus optional `fsProfile`, `default_input`, `timeout_seconds`, and optional `session`. `TargetRef` is the authoring-facing form: `target: activity:<name>`. It is resolved away before execution.

Phase 3 also made step-local input layering explicit, but the shipped behavior changed in [T20260423-0445]. Job-level `default_input` now behaves as follows:

- if the caller passes `null`, the run input becomes `job.default_input`
- if both the caller input and `job.default_input` are JSON objects, Orbit performs a shallow merge and caller-supplied keys win on conflict
- if the caller input is any non-object JSON value, it replaces `job.default_input` entirely

Step-level `default_input` is still recursively template-rendered before dispatch. Support for step default inputs landed earlier in [T20260413-0141] and was pulled into the v2 DAG path in [T20260418-2018]; [T20260423-0445] corrected the job-level merge contract so seeded workflows like `task_auto_pipeline` can rely on omitted keys inheriting defaults.

---

## 4. Load-Time Normalization Pipeline

The code does not dispatch the raw YAML shape. orbit-core normalizes it first.

Catalog-discovered v2 jobs use `MergeByKey` precedence after [T20260425-0204]: `ORBIT_JOB_DIR` / `ORBIT_V2_JOB_DIR` entries first, then workspace jobs, then global seeded jobs. The first valid `metadata.name` wins, so a workspace `task_auto_pipeline` overrides the global default without making `orbit run ship` fail. Duplicate names inside one directory tree remain invalid because that single layer would otherwise be ambiguous.

Activity catalogs follow the same first-wins rule after [T20260426-0047]: `ORBIT_ACTIVITY_DIR` / `ORBIT_V2_CATALOG_DIR` entries first, then workspace activities, then global seeded activities. This lets a workspace carry an override such as `pr_open` without `orbit activity list --ops` failing on the duplicate global default. Duplicate names inside one activity directory tree remain invalid.

For direct single-activity execution inside runtime helpers:

1. Read YAML from disk.
2. Parse via `load_activity_asset(...)`.
3. Resolve `backend: auto` to a concrete backend.
4. Build audit sinks and run id with `system` as the v2 envelope `agent_identity`.
5. Dispatch the concrete `ActivityV2Spec`.

For a job run:

1. Read YAML from disk.
2. Parse via `load_job_asset(...)`.
3. Build the activity catalog from seeded/workspace activity directories.
4. Resolve every `target: activity:<name>` into a concrete `TargetStep` and resolve any job-level or step-level `recovery_activity` into a cached activity spec.
5. Resolve every `backend: auto` in the now-concrete step tree.
6. Reject loop-body `session:` bindings that resolve to `backend: cli`.
7. Build audit sinks and run id with `system` as the v2 envelope `agent_identity`.
8. Execute the normalized `JobV2`.

The target-ref pass was added in [T20260418-2019]. The concrete backend resolution and `run-v2` entrypoints were wired in [T20260418-2143]. The CLI backend path and the HTTP-only loop/session rejection tightened this load-time contract in [T20260419-0104].

The public CLI now executes activity assets through jobs rather than exposing a standalone `orbit activity run` subcommand. `orbit activity` is an inspection/catalog surface; `orbit job run` and workflow aliases under `orbit run` are the public execution surfaces after [T20260426-0047].

One nuance worth naming: some module comments still describe older Phase ordering. The authoritative behavior is the orbit-core call path above in `crates/orbit-core/src/command/job_v2.rs`.

Seeded direct shipment workflows (`task_local_pipeline` and `task_pr_pipeline`) opt into `recovery_activity: step_failure_recovery` on specific steps after [T20260430-14]. That default activity is a CLI-backed `agent_loop`: it receives only the executor-provided recovery keys, manually inspects the failed step, makes bounded repairs when safe, and returns before the executor makes its single post-recovery attempt. Higher-level orchestration workflows (`task_gate_pipeline`, `task_auto_pipeline`, `task_epic_pipeline`, and `job_duel_plan_pipeline`) do not enable the generic hook because replaying child-run dispatch or planning orchestration is not a safe default recovery action.

The seeded `list_backlog_tasks` deterministic activity is the first `task_auto_pipeline` step. In automatic mode it emits `task_count`, `task_ids`, `tasks`, singleton `bundles`, and an `excluded` array for backlog tasks filtered before gate dispatch because their context files overlap `in-progress` or `review` task locks. The exclusion entries are only for that lock-overlap filter: friction filtering and `max_tasks` truncation remain silent, and explicit `task_ids` override mode omits `excluded` because it skips the filter entirely. This attribution contract was added in [T20260421-0542-2].

---

## 5. Backend Resolution and Constraint Rules

`Backend::Auto` is never supposed to reach dispatch. orbit-core resolves it once per run using the precedence chain implemented in `backend_resolver.rs`:

1. `--backend=<value>`
2. `ORBIT_BACKEND`
3. `[runtime] backend = "<value>"` in config
4. hard-coded fallback `http`

If any intermediate tier literally says `auto`, the resolver folds it to the hard-coded fallback so the dispatcher only sees `http` or `cli`. That "resolve once, dispatch concrete" rule was introduced with the `run-v2` entrypoints in [T20260418-2143] and hardened for the CLI path in [T20260419-0104].

The second rule is the HTTP-only feature constraint. Today the only public item in that list is loop-body cross-iteration `session:` binding. `validate_job_loop_session_backends(...)` rejects a step inside `loop:` that declares `session:` while resolving to `backend: cli`. The error text intentionally names the feature and the fix, because the job has not started yet; there is no useful retry path.

The third rule is no silent provider fallback. `backend: http` against an unwired provider fails as `UnwiredHttpTransport` rather than quietly launching a CLI runtime. That choice matters because providers and backends are separate choices in the schema, not aliases.

The prescriptive contract for this area lives in [specs/backend-resolution.md](./specs/backend-resolution.md).

---

## 6. Engine-Core Boundary

Activity / Job is the seam where orbit-core hands work to orbit-engine without taking a dependency on `orbit-agent` types.

`V2RuntimeHost` is the key boundary. orbit-core implements it and supplies five services back into the engine:

- run a deterministic action by name
- source an API key for a provider
- resolve a provider's CLI executor command plus static args
- build `ToolContext` for an activity, including policy and filesystem audit hooks
- persist invocation traces for completed agent-loop work

That host wiring arrived in [T20260418-2143]. The cleanup in [T20260418-2210] made the boundary primitive on purpose: the engine receives strings, `Value`, and `ToolContext`, not `orbit-agent` transport objects.

`dispatch_v2_activity(...)` is the central per-activity entry. It emits `ActivityStarted` / `ActivityFinished` envelope events, then delegates by spec kind:

- `agent_loop` → HTTP or CLI path
- `groundhog` → Groundhog runner
- `deterministic` → host callback
- `shell` → direct subprocess execution

That makes the dispatch tree readable in one place while keeping provider/session construction below the boundary.

---

## 7. Agent Loop Backend Paths

### 7.1 HTTP path

The HTTP path is driven by `agent_loop_driver.rs`. It:

- creates or reuses a `Session`
- constructs a `ToolContext`
- chooses a transport
- runs `orbit-agent`'s `AgentLoop`

Today that transport path is narrower than the schema surface suggests. `Provider::has_http_transport()` currently returns true only for `claude`, so the non-replay path uses `AnthropicMessagesTransport`. `ORBIT_V2_REPLAY` and `ORBIT_V2_REPLAY_FIXTURE` provide a scripted replay transport for smoke runs and loop convergence tests.

The allowlist is enforced in the loop engine on this path. A denied tool becomes a structural `DispatchError::ToolDenied` so the job retry wrapper can classify it as non-retryable.

After [T20260426-0526], completed HTTP loop outcomes are converted into `InvocationTrace` records and persisted through the host under the job run ID and step ID. That includes loop-body `session:` steps, which use a separate session-aware executor path but feed the same invocation metrics store.

### 7.2 CLI path

The CLI path is driven by `cli_runner.rs`, added in [T20260419-0104]. The flow is:

1. Ask the host for the concrete CLI executor: command plus static executor args.
2. Build an `Agent` from `orbit-agent`.
3. Ask the retained CLI runtime for an `AgentInvocationSpec` containing provider-specific per-request args.
4. Emit the advisory `ToolAllowlistHarnessDelegated` event.
5. Emit `CliInvocationStarted` with redacted argv and stdin blob ref.
6. Spawn the subprocess with a wall-clock timeout.
7. Emit `CliInvocationFinished` with stdout/stderr blob refs and timeout state.
8. Parse the captured provider output with the existing Orbit response parser and persist its `InvocationTrace` through the host.

After [T20260426-2313], the subprocess stdout/stderr readers stream line-level `tracing::info!` events while the child is still running. Each event carries `provider`, `stream`, `job_run_id`, `task_id`, and `line`; after [T20260426-2349], the reader emits the raw newline-stripped line and the default tracing subscriber redacts string field values and `Debug`-formatted field values before stderr or JSONL output is written. The readers still retain the original stdout/stderr byte buffers and hand those buffers to the existing audit/blob path when `CliInvocationFinished` is emitted, so run-log readers keep following blob refs rather than the live tracing feed.

Executor args are prepended before provider runtime args. For the seeded Codex executor, that means the subprocess starts as `codex exec --json ...`, not as the interactive `codex` TUI with piped stdin. This was tightened after a local ship run for [T20260423-0114] exposed that the earlier command-only boundary ignored executor args.

After [T20260427-48], provider runtime args also receive the runtime's provider config through the same `V2RuntimeHost` boundary. Static executor definitions keep command-shape flags such as `exec --json`; dynamic provider settings such as Codex sandbox mode, writable side directories, and approval policy stay in the retained provider runtime. Codex approval policy is passed as an exec-compatible config override rather than as the interactive-only `--ask-for-approval` flag after `exec`.

After [T20260427-51], macOS CLI invocations whose executor declares `sandbox: macos-sandbox-exec` are wrapped as `sandbox-exec -f <profile.sb> <provider> ...`. In that mode Orbit treats the outer SBPL profile as the filesystem authority and neutralizes provider-native sandbox flags: Codex is pinned to `--sandbox danger-full-access`, and Gemini's sandbox toggle is removed. After [T20260428-10], the generated profile also grants the Codex state directory (`$CODEX_HOME`, or `$HOME/.codex` when unset) so Codex can initialize before reading Orbit's envelope. Codex side-write roots from runtime provider config (the same roots passed as `--add-dir`, today workspace `.orbit` and global `.orbit`) are appended after policy denies so inherited Orbit subprocesses can persist workflow state while ordinary project-content writes remain governed by the resolved `fsProfile`.

After [T20260430-15], the CLI agent stdin envelope carries the rendered activity input and durable `run_id` alongside the activity instruction, prompt, tools, and model. When that input identifies a single task, orbit-core also embeds a canonical task snapshot (`id`, title, description, acceptance criteria, plan, pr number, and context files) with `input.workspace_path` / `input.repo_root` taking precedence over the stored task paths. This keeps task executors from having to infer the target task from ambient run history when the human-facing prompt string is empty or generic.

The important retention boundary is that the older `AgentRuntime` trait and `providers/*_cli.rs` files are not deprecated leftovers. They are the shipped implementation of `backend: cli`.

Just as important, Orbit does not enforce tool allowlists on this path today. It records the declared tool set as an advisory and delegates enforcement to the provider harness. This is a real semantic gap between `backend: http` and `backend: cli`.

---

## 8. Job Execution Semantics

### 8.1 Template rendering and pipeline context

The executor wraps pipeline outputs so templates read them as `{{ steps.<id>.output.* }}`. The initial pipeline context starts from the merged run input contract described in §3: object-valued caller input overlays object-valued `job.default_input`, while `null` and non-object inputs keep their special-case behavior. Step `default_input` is rendered recursively through the template engine; strings that parse as JSON are converted back into `Value`, so booleans, numbers, arrays, and objects can flow forward without remaining strings.

`fan_out` workers additionally see `{{ item }}` / `{{ input.item }}`. Loop bodies additionally see `{{ input.iteration }}`.

### 8.2 `when` and `retry`

`when` is evaluated once, before retry. A skipped step is a successful no-op and does not retry.

The retry wrapper re-runs the whole step body up to `max_attempts`, using exponential or linear backoff. Some errors bypass retry entirely:

- tool denial
- unknown deterministic action
- shell allowlist violation
- host-required / backend-resolution structural errors
- job validation errors

That rule comes straight from `DispatchError::is_non_retryable()`.

### 8.3 `parallel`

Parallel branches run under `std::thread::scope`. The join policy is one of:

- `all`
- `any`
- `quorum { n }`

The executor emits a `StepJoin` event with per-branch outcomes. If the join policy fails and at least one branch produced a structural error, the first error is surfaced instead of returning only `success: false`.

### 8.4 `fan_out` / `fan_in`

`fan_out.items` is template-rendered into an array. Workers run concurrently behind a counting semaphore, so `max_workers` is a true concurrency bound, not just metadata. `fan_in.collect` can persist the ordered worker outputs under a separate pipeline key in addition to the step id itself.

Workers execute with isolated pipeline/session maps. That isolation is why the validator rejects any worker template that names a `session:` binding: concurrent workers would otherwise share one mutable `Session`.

### 8.5 `loop`

A loop runs either:

- once per rendered `items` entry
- or up to `max_iterations` when `items` is absent

The loop body runs before `break_when` is evaluated, so body steps can populate the pipeline fields the break expression reads. If `items` expands beyond `max_iterations`, the executor fails structurally instead of silently truncating the iteration set.

### 8.6 Persisted state for v2 job runs

Persisted pipeline runs (`orbit run ship`, `orbit run ship-auto`, `orbit run duel-plan`, `orbit.pipeline.invoke` + `orbit.pipeline.wait`) are stored through `pipeline_run.rs`. Direct v2 runs (`orbit job run <job-id-or-yaml>`) also create a durable `JobRun` bundle after [T20260423-2004-4], using the same workspace-local `state/job-runs/<job_id>/<run_id>/` layout so `orbit run history -j <job_id>` and `orbit run show <run_id>` can inspect the returned run ID. The workflow-specific `orbit run <workflow> list/show` aliases were removed in [T20260425-2010], and duplicate job-level inspection aliases were removed in [T20260426-0742], so history inspection has one public surface.

Before [T20260423-0445], a v2 workflow that failed before any concrete step file was written could leave behind a failed `JobRun` with `steps: []` and no surfaced `error_message`, even when the underlying executor had a concrete reason.

The current contract is:

- if a persisted v2 pipeline fails and no recorded step already carries error detail, the pipeline worker writes a synthetic failed `JobRunStep`
- if a direct v2 run succeeds, the direct-run wrapper writes a synthetic successful `JobRunStep` containing the final pipeline snapshot
- that synthetic step uses `target_type: job` and `target_id: <job_id>`
- the step's `error_message` carries the concrete executor error (or a fallback `success=false` summary for message-carrying non-success results)

This is intentionally an operator-surface repair, not a new execution primitive. It keeps `orbit run ship --json`, direct `orbit job run` output, `orbit run history`, and `orbit run show` actionable without introducing a second run-level error channel in `JobRun`.

The loop shares the same pipeline map and session map across iterations. That is what makes cross-iteration `session:` binding meaningful in the first place.

### 8.7 Invocation metrics

The `orbit metrics` command reads knowledge usage from job-run state and agent/tool usage from the SQLite invocation store. It does not scrape `.orbit/state/audit/v2_loop/` or the diagnostics JSONL stream.

V2 jobs therefore persist invocation traces as an explicit execution side effect after [T20260426-0526]. The engine carries optional trace data on `DispatchOutcome`, the job executor associates it with the durable run ID and step ID, and orbit-core inserts it into the invocation store with canonical agent/model names plus task IDs extracted from the rendered step input. The same persistence hook refreshes the token scoreboard.

For `backend: cli`, the trace comes from the provider's structured stdout using the same parser that validates Orbit response envelopes. For the HTTP loop path, the trace is derived from `LoopOutcome` usage and tool-call names.

### 8.8 Run trace inspection

`orbit run show`, `orbit run logs`, `orbit run events`, and `orbit run trace` are the operator surfaces for already-scheduled runs. They all resolve an omitted run ID to the most recently scheduled run.

After [T20260426-0709], `orbit run show <run> -s <id>` treats the v2 audit envelope's activity DAG `step.id` as the primary identifier. That matters because durable v2 runs may store a synthetic job-level `JobRunStep` whose `target_id` is the job ID, while the audit envelope still records the actual YAML step IDs. The legacy `JobRunStep.target_id` and numeric `step_index` remain fallback selectors.

After [T20260426-0705], `orbit run events <run>` reads the v2 envelope chronologically and can filter by activity step ID or event type. `orbit run trace <run>` renders the parent/child tree from `event_id` and `parent_event_id`. JSON mode for both commands returns deterministic structures for tests and downstream tooling.

The CLI does not own the envelope storage layout. `orbit-core` exposes runtime accessors for v2 audit events and CLI invocation records, including derived step IDs and blob-backed stdout/stderr. This keeps `.orbit/state/audit/v2_loop/` and `.orbit/state/audit/blobs/` knowledge with the runtime layer that also builds the activity/job audit sinks.

### 8.9 Workflow worktree base synchronization

Task-shipping workflows that create worktrees (`task_pr_pipeline`, `task_local_pipeline`, and callers such as `task_auto_pipeline`) default `base_sync` to `remote` after [T20260427-45]. In that mode the deterministic worktree automation fetches `origin/<base_branch>` and creates, resets, compares, and rebases task branches against that fetched remote-tracking ref. It does not run `git pull --rebase` from the repo root checkout, and it does not silently prefer a stale local base branch.

Direct job callers can set `base_sync: local` when they intentionally need a local-only repository or an unpublished base branch. That mode resolves the local base ref and skips the origin fetch; it is an explicit escape hatch rather than the default shipping behavior.

### 8.10 Workflow task admission

After [T20260428-8], task-starting workflows own an explicit admission step instead of relying on generic task update semantics. `worktree_setup` and `run_planning_duel` accept tasks in `proposed`, `friction`, `backlog`, `rejected`, and `archived`, and move them to `in-progress` before implementation or planner activity runs. Existing `in-progress` tasks are treated as idempotent retry inputs.

This admission path is intentionally narrower than `orbit.task.update` or generic deterministic metadata stamping. Direct task updates still keep their non-empty-plan guard when moving unplanned non-backlog work to `in-progress`, and `apply_task_automation_update` does not become a blanket archived-task resurrection surface. Workflow admission records the lifecycle transition under the system actor and preserves friction-bounty accounting for `friction -> in-progress`.

Planning-duel writeback now reports `task_status: "in-progress"` rather than the former `status_unchanged` signal. The task plan artifact still lands through `planning_duel_resolved`; only the lifecycle expectation changed.

---

## 9. Filesystem Policy and `fsProfile`

Both `ActivityV2` and `TargetStep` can attach an `fsProfile`. orbit-core uses `tool_context_for_activity(...)` to build the policy-aware `ToolContext`, and `V2AuditWriter` can attach a filesystem audit logger so read/write denials are reflected in the envelope event stream.

The runtime/CLI enforcement tightening landed in [T20260419-0503]. The practical effect is that `fsProfile` is part of the activity/job contract, not an optional CLI presentation detail.

One subtlety: profile attachment happens at two layers.

- An activity asset may declare its own `fsProfile`.
- A target step may override or supply one around an inlined activity spec.

This is useful, but it means readers have to distinguish "profile on the reusable activity" from "profile on the place this activity is called."

---

## 10. Legacy Surfaces and Retention Boundaries

This feature spans a migration, so the docs need to say plainly what is gone, what is still intentionally present, and why.

### 10.1 Retention Table

| Surface | Current status | Rationale |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| `schemaVersion: 1` activity/job assets | Retired | Load-time hard error after [T20260419-2156]. |
| v2 `agent_loop` HTTP path | Kept | Canonical typed runtime path from [T20260418-2010]. |
| v2 `agent_loop` CLI path | Kept | Implemented by the retained `AgentRuntime` trait and `providers/*_cli.rs` after [T20260419-0104]. |
| `TargetRef` authoring form | Kept at authoring/load time only | Human-friendly YAML surface; resolved away before execution since [T20260418-2019]. |
| v1 `crate::job_runner` | Kept | Older sequential/DAG runtime still exists beside the v2 executor; Phase 3 was additive in [T20260418-2018]. |
| Seeded reference activities and jobs | Kept | They act as runnable contracts and examples, and were moved into init seeding in [T20260419-2347]. |
| Groundhog as a dedicated activity kind | Kept | Explicit sibling activity after [T20260420-0510-2], not an `agent_loop` toggle. |

### 10.2 Seeded Assets in Practice

The seeded asset set is part of the design, not just repo clutter. Today it includes:

- small reference activities such as `agent_loop_reference` and `agent_loop_cli_reference`
- control-plane jobs such as `task_gate_pipeline`
- higher-level dispatch workflows such as `task_auto_pipeline`, `task_epic_pipeline`, and `job_duel_plan_pipeline`

The gate/auto/epic assets added in [T20260419-0622-3], [T20260419-0623], and [T20260419-0623-2] are especially useful because they exercise the real v2 constructs instead of describing them abstractly:

- `loop + break_when`
- `fan_out + fan_in`
- cross-iteration `session:` binding
- deterministic child-job dispatch

That seeded corpus is the closest thing Activity / Job has to executable reference documentation.

## 11. Concerns & Honest Limitations

### 11.1 Provider typing is broader than provider wiring

The `Provider` enum names `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `ollama`, and `openai_compat`, but the HTTP transport path currently wires only `claude`. The schema reads more general than the runtime is.

### 11.2 Tool enforcement differs materially by backend

HTTP agent loops enforce the tool allowlist inside Orbit. CLI agent loops emit an advisory event and rely on the provider harness. Same field, different enforcement model.

### 11.3 Some structural controls are still literals

`LoopBlock.max_iterations` and `FanOutBlock.max_workers` are structural `u32`s, not templated expressions. Real workflows like `task_auto_pipeline` therefore have to fork YAML to change those limits dynamically.

### 11.4 Validation is split across phases

Some bad shapes are rejected at load time, some at job preflight validation, and some during dispatch. This is pragmatic, but it means the "where will this fail?" answer is not yet uniform.

### 11.5 The audit story is powerful but split

The v2 envelope tree lives in `.orbit/state/audit/v2_loop/`. The loop-engine HTTP details live in the sibling `.orbit/state/audit/loop/` sink, and verbatim payload blobs live under `.orbit/state/audit/blobs/`. That split is intentional, but reviewers still need to know two related layouts. [T20260426-0519] moved these file-backed run traces under `.orbit/state/` so the top-level `.orbit/` directory remains reserved for configuration, resources, tasks, graph artifacts, and the SQLite command-audit database.

### 11.6 The substrate still leaks into the public product story

README already frames tasks, jobs, and activities as substrate rather than the long-term product interface. The code agrees, but the CLI and seeded assets still expose this layer directly because Orbit needs it to operate today.

### 11.7 Nearby comments still carry migration-era drift

Most code comments are accurate, but some module prose still reflects earlier phase names or pass ordering. When there is tension, orbit-core entrypoints and executor behavior are the authoritative source.

### 11.8 Historical run inspection belongs to the run surface

Read-only history surfaces do not always have the same dependency shape as live execution. [T20260423-0447] proved that retired workflow runs can remain observable without live assets, [T20260425-2010] removed workflow-specific history browsers, and [T20260426-0742] removed the duplicate job-level inspection aliases. Current public inspection belongs to `orbit run history -j <job_id>` and `orbit run show <run_id>`, while `orbit job` is reserved for job catalog browsing and direct job execution.
