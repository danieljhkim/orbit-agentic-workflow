# Spec: Backend Resolution and Session Constraints

> **v1 release scope.** v1 ships `backend: cli` as the only supported agent invocation path. The `backend: http` resolution rules below are still load-bearing in code (the resolver still runs, and HTTP-only constraints are still enforced for `loop`/`session:`), but `backend: http` is **not** part of the v1 release surface. Treat any HTTP-related rule below as preview-only until v2.

Activity / Job assets must never reach dispatch with unresolved backend intent. Orbit resolves `backend: auto` to a concrete backend once per run, then validates the concrete shape before execution begins. This keeps backend choice, provider wiring, and session semantics auditable instead of implicit.

## Why This Exists

Backend choice affects runtime behavior in ways that are not interchangeable:

- HTTP vs CLI has different tool-enforcement semantics.
- Only some providers have HTTP transports wired.
- Cross-iteration `session:` binding only makes sense on the HTTP loop path.

Treating backend resolution as an early normalization step keeps those differences explicit.

## Resolution Order

Orbit resolves `backend: auto` using this precedence order:

1. CLI flag override
2. `ORBIT_BACKEND`
3. config `[runtime] backend`
4. hard-coded fallback `http`

If any tier literally says `auto`, Orbit folds it to the hard-coded fallback. Downstream code must only observe `http` or `cli`.

## Invariants

- `Backend::Auto` does not survive past the orbit-core load path.
- `target: activity:<name>` resolution happens before job execution begins.
- A loop-body step with `session:` must resolve to `backend: http`.
- `backend: http` against an unwired provider fails structurally; it does not silently fall back to CLI.
- Concurrent shapes (`parallel`, `fan_out`) may not share one named `session:` binding.

## Failure Modes

- Invalid backend flag or config values reject the run before dispatch.
- Unresolved `TargetRef` reaching the executor is a caller bug and surfaces as `JobValidation`.
- Loop/session/backend incompatibility rejects the job at load time when possible and again at runtime if a flat target shape still violates the rule.
- `backend: http` plus unwired provider returns `UnwiredHttpTransport`.

## Migration Notes

- `schemaVersion: 1` assets are retired and do not participate in this contract.
- `backend: cli` intentionally retains the older CLI-provider runtime implementation; this is not a temporary compatibility shim.
- Jobs that need persistent conversation history across iterations must choose HTTP-capable activities explicitly.
