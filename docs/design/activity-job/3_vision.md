# Activity / Job — Vision

**Status:** Draft
**Owner:** codex
**Last updated:** 2026-04-30

This document pressure-tests where the Activity / Job substrate may go next. It starts from the v2 runtime shipped across [T20260418-2010], [T20260418-2018], [T20260418-2143], [T20260418-2210], [T20260419-0104], and [T20260419-2156]. [2_design.md](./2_design.md) is the current contract; this file asks what should harden, collapse, or disappear.

## 1. Open Questions

### 1.1 How much of Activity / Job should remain public?

README frames tasks, jobs, and activities as substrate. Should Orbit keep this layer mostly internal, with goals/sessions/locks as the API, or does a durable local system still need human-editable workflows?

### 1.2 Should `target:` grow beyond `activity:<name>`?

`TargetRef` is namespace-prefixed, but only `activity:<name>` exists after [T20260418-2019]. Do nested job refs, subroutine refs, or cross-workspace refs help, or would they turn this layer into a generic workflow engine?

### 1.3 Is the provider model too closed-set?

The schema names multiple providers, but the HTTP transport path is still effectively single-provider today. Do we keep the closed enum and wire each transport deliberately, or move toward a more explicit "provider capability" registry?

### 1.4 Should Orbit enforce tool allowlists on the CLI backend?

The gap from [T20260419-0104] is significant: HTTP enforces, CLI advises. Does `backend: cli` need a wrapper so `tools:` means the same thing everywhere?

### 1.5 Which limits should stay structural literals?

`task_auto_pipeline` and `task_epic_pipeline` rely on literal `max_workers` and `max_iterations`. Should those stay static, or do we need templated numerics?

### 1.6 What is the right audit landing zone?

The v2 envelope from [T20260419-0002] makes runs traversable, but the full HTTP transcript still lives in the sibling loop sink. Should review converge on one query surface even if files remain separate?

### 1.7 How much more special-casing belongs in ActivityV2?

Groundhog's dedicated kind from [T20260420-0510-2] is justified today. If more modes arrive, do we keep adding variants, or is that a sign the abstraction is stale?

### 1.8 What should become the canonical reference corpus?

Seeded assets added in [T20260419-2347] and extended in [T20260419-0622-3], [T20260419-0623], and [T20260419-0623-2] already act as executable docs. Should they become the main reference set, or do we need smaller spec-only exemplars?

## 2. Prior Work

Activity / Job productizes familiar ideas. The interesting question is whether Orbit's mix is local, inspectable, and agent-friendly enough to matter.

### 2.1 Durable workflow engines

- **Temporal** treats replay-safe orchestration and activity boundaries as first-class runtime concepts.
- **Argo Workflows** and **GitHub Actions** show that human-authored YAML orchestration is still valuable even when higher-level product abstractions exist.
- **LangGraph** has made durable, stateful control flow part of the mainstream agent-tooling vocabulary.

Activity / Job borrows the idea that orchestration must survive outside one model turn, but keeps the runtime local-first and repo-scoped.

### 2.2 Agent runtimes and tool loops

- **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Gemini CLI**, and similar tools normalize the "agent loop plus tools" model.
- **OpenAI-compatible** and provider-native HTTP APIs normalize direct transport-level loops.

Orbit's difference is that a tool loop is one typed activity inside a durable runtime with local audit, policy, and job control-flow.

### 2.3 Policy-aware execution substrates

- Sandbox and policy systems in CI/CD platforms establish the norm that execution policy is part of the runtime contract, not just ambient environment.
- Agent harnesses frequently expose allowlists, but many treat them as soft guidance rather than a load-bearing runtime surface.

Orbit's `fsProfile` attachment and the HTTP/CLI enforcement split make this concern explicit, even if the current behavior is still uneven.

### 2.4 Executable reference assets

- Mature workflow systems almost always ship example pipelines, starter templates, or scaffolded defaults.

Orbit's seeded activities and jobs from [T20260419-2347] are already more than examples; they are the closest thing to an executable spec corpus.

---

## 3. What May Be Distinctive

Soft claims only:

- **Load-time normalization as a public contract.** Target-ref resolution, backend concretization, and loop/session rejection are part of what a job *is*, not just hidden parser details.
- **Backend choice separated from provider choice.** Orbit treats `backend: http|cli|auto` and `provider: ...` as orthogonal schema fields, then makes mismatches explicit instead of silently recovering.
- **A two-layer audit tree tied to repo provenance.** The v2 envelope from [T20260419-0002] gives runs, steps, activities, and workspace origin a stable skeleton while still preserving the underlying loop transcript and blobs.
- **Seeded workflows as load-bearing contracts.** The shipped jobs from [T20260419-0622-3], [T20260419-0623], and [T20260419-0623-2] are not toy examples; they are how the control-flow substrate proves itself against real Orbit work.

None of these are research contributions. Activity / Job earns its keep only if it stays understandable, local, and inspectable while the product evolves.
