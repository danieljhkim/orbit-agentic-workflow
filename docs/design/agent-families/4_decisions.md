# Agent Families — Decisions

ADR entries are append-only and ordered ascending by global ID. New entries are allocated via `orbit.adr.add` *before* the local heading is written — see [../CONVENTIONS.md §4](../CONVENTIONS.md) and the `orbit-adr` skill. The local heading uses the allocated global ID verbatim.

Historical note: prior to 2026-05-17, ADR-0154 / ADR-0155 / ADR-0156 in this file were authored with locally-invented IDs (`ADR-0152` / `ADR-0153` / `ADR-0154`) that did not match the global store. They were re-allocated through `orbit.adr.add` per [ORB-00098]; the original local IDs survive as `legacy_ids` so prior citations still resolve.

## ADR-0151 — Add Grok (xAI) as a fourth peer agent family

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-05-16 · [ORB-00042] · [ORB-00043] · [ORB-00044] · [ORB-00045] · [ORB-00046] · [ORB-00052] · legacy_id: `agent-families/ADR-0151`

**Decision:** Treat "grok" as a full peer alongside claude, codex, and gemini.

**Key Changes:**
- Extended `agent_from_model()`, `infer_agent_family_from_model()`, `all_agent_families()`, `resolve_agent_model_pair()`, and `provider_from_model()`
- Added `grok.yaml` executor skeleton and sandbox support (tasks ORB-00044, ORB-00045)
- Added Grok provider to `orbit mcp init` (ORB-00046)
- Created this design doc folder (ORB-00052)

## ADR-0154 — Replace `[agent.<role>]` tables with named `[crews.*]` registry

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-05 · [ORB-00058] · legacy_id: `agent-families/ADR-0152`

**Context.** Workspace config previously selected planner, implementer, and reviewer models with three top-level `[agent.<role>]` tables, while task execution had no durable way to request a different lineup. Layering a new registry beside the old role tables would have forced Orbit to validate and explain two schemas for the same decision.

**Decision.** Replace the role-keyed config shape wholesale with named `[crews.<name>]` entries and `[workflow].default_crew`. A task may store `crew`, and a run may override it with CLI/tool input; precedence is CLI override, then task field, then workspace default.

**Consequences.**
- "Crew" was chosen over "profile" because profiles sound user-scoped, and over "pair" because the lineup contains planner, implementer, and reviewer.
- Run records persist the resolved crew plus the three role model strings so audit trails survive later config edits.
- The v2 `agent_loop` dispatch path reads role models from the crew registry (`crates/orbit-core/src/runtime/engine/environment_host.rs`). Scoreboard and friction projections use family identity after ADR-0156; exact model strings remain visible through resolved crew/run configuration.
- Deferred: duel-plan participant configuration, per-role task overrides, and planner-vs-executor workflow split.
- Cost: old workspaces with only `[agent.planner]`, `[agent.implementer]`, and `[agent.reviewer]` must migrate before config load succeeds.

## ADR-0155 — Scope duel-plan candidate and model overrides to `[duel]`

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-05 · [ORB-00072] · legacy_id: `agent-families/ADR-0153`

**Context.** Duel-plan previously walked the full `all_agent_families()` registry and used the same model-pair resolution chain as non-duel callers. That made local CLI availability load-bearing for every supported family and made reproducible planning-duel scoreboards depend on executor YAML state.

**Decision.** Add a workspace `[duel]` section with `candidates` as a normalized subset of `all_agent_families()` and `[duel.models]` as flat orchestrator-only per-family overrides. Duel role selection reads those values through `RuntimeHost`; non-duel callers continue to use executor overrides and builtin model pairs.

**Consequences.**
- Duel permutations remain dynamic but require at least three distinct configured families.
- `[duel.models]` wins only for duel role-model lookup; helper models and non-duel model identity are unchanged.
- The crew registry remains separate from duel participant selection. Reusing `[crews.*]` for duels was rejected because duels need a family pool, not a fixed planner/implementer/reviewer lineup.

## ADR-0156 — Collapse agent identity to family and move model strings to configuration

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-05 · [ORB-00080] · legacy_id: `agent-families/ADR-0154`

**Context.** Planning-duel artifacts and scoreboards compared model strings even though model names drift across aliases, CLI shorthand, and self-reported tool payloads. A Gemini planner configured as `pro` could produce an artifact stamped `gemini-3.1-pro`; both values describe the same family but failed equality checks. Alias tables (`resolve_agent_model_pair*`, `matches_model_alias`, `canonical_model_for_agent`) treated the symptom and grew with every provider change.

**Decision.** Family is identity, model is configuration, and slot is role. Orbit identity surfaces use exactly `codex`, `claude`, `gemini`, or `grok`. Planning-duel assignments persist `family`; `planner_a`, `planner_b`, and `arbiter` are explicit slots used in artifact paths and signatures. Exact model strings stay in crew config, `[duel.models]`, CLI invocation translation, and resolved-crew run records.

**Consequences.**
- New planning-duel artifacts are written as `planning-duel/{slot}.md` and signed `*authored by: {family} / {slot}*`; historical model-path artifacts remain a legacy read concern.
- Runtime tool boundaries treat envelope identity as authoritative. Agent-supplied `model` fields are overwritten with the canonical family before persistence/comparison so self-report drift cannot affect validation.
- Scoreboard and friction projections are family-keyed (`by_family`) when they answer "who actually ran?". Resolved-crew projections remain the source for "who was selected?" because they describe configured routing.
- The legacy resolver and alias-canonicalization surfaces are deleted from production code. `infer_agent_family_from_model` remains for legacy artifact recovery and CLI invocation translation.
- ORB-00079 and ORB-00071 are superseded by this structural identity change.

## ADR-0167 — Favor claude (opus) for planner role on planning duels and design-shaped plans

**Status:** Proposed · 2026-05-18 · cites [AO-002](../../agent-observations/AO-002/observation.md) · (acceptance pending a related task — see lifecycle note in adr-artifact/2_design.md §5)

**Context.** AO-002 ([Instruction surface shapes plan output, not tool selection](../../agent-observations/AO-002/observation.md)) closed on 2026-05-18 after four experiments spanning four Gemini-as-planner implementation/audit duels and one 4-model cross-read on an identical UX-design task. Three observations recurred across the thread:

- Gemini ranked last on plan depth on every task shape tested (implementation, audit, refactor, UX-taste), losing every duel it played as planner. Arbiter rationales consistently cited graph-discovery gaps, hallucinated symbols, generic findings, and thin ADR content.
- Claude won every duel it entered as planner in the window, including the UX-redesign duel (ORB-00154), where claude's metric-major layout call was the differentiating taste signal. Codex placed in the middle — thorough plans without bold design calls, ranked above grok and gemini but below claude on plan depth in the 4-way UX comparison.
- Instruction-surface levers (memory file or per-run prompt) shifted Gemini's output structure (verification commands, severity-tagged findings, section format) but not its tool selection. Three rounds of prompt strengthening did not change the duel outcome.

AO-002 scope: planning-duel plan quality on the Orbit codebase, single window in May 2026, ad-hoc task selection, model versions not held constant (gemini-2.5-pro on two runs, gemini-3.1-pro-preview on three). The thread is explicitly framed as decision-grade-for-us, not an objective ranking.

**Decision.** Until new evidence warrants otherwise, default the planner role on planning duels and design-shaped plans to **claude** (currently `claude-opus-4-x` per workspace crew config). This applies to both implementation-shaped planning and UX / design-shaped planning. The choice is provisional and bound to AO-002's evidence window; AO-002's open questions (post-rubric run on `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` against an implementation task, plan-depth response to a volume-rubric clause, new model-family releases) are the natural triggers for revisiting.

**Consequences.**

- Crew defaults that select a planner family should favor `claude` when no per-task override is set. `[duel.candidates]` continues to include all four families so duels remain genuine plan-vs-plan comparisons; this ADR governs single-planner selection and tie-breaking guidance, not duel participation.
- Arbiter selection is unchanged. AO-002 finding D observed that Gemini-as-arbiter performed adequately even where Gemini-as-planner did not; reading completed work is a different cognitive task than producing it.
- Implementer selection is unchanged. AO-002's scope is planning-duel plan quality only; implementer rankings live in a separate observation thread when there's data.
- Re-evaluation triggers: (1) a new Gemini-family release with a stable model alias; (2) the missing AO-002 experimental cell (post-rubric Gemini run on `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` against an implementation-shaped task) producing a counter-finding; (3) a non-Orbit codebase producing a different ranking; (4) a same-task within-model-version repeat that flips the outcome. Any of these reopens AO-002 or spawns a follow-up observation that this ADR must be reconciled against.
- Cost: surrendering planning diversity. Defaulting to one family forfeits the safety net of cross-family disagreement, concentrates dependency on a single provider, and risks anchoring on claude's distinctive design patterns (e.g. the metric-major preference observed in ORB-00154) as if they were universally correct. The duel mechanism partially mitigates this when explicitly invoked: a duel still gathers multiple plans before selecting one.
