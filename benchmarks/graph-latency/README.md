# Graph Latency Benchmark

kind: perf

Measures wall-clock latency of `orbit.graph.*` MCP tool invocations on large polyglot mono-repos. No agent in the loop — direct tool calls only. Answers the question: *for a given orbit revision, how fast is each graph tool on a real-world large corpus, and where are we over budget?*

This benchmark is the durable signal for graph-tool perf work. Improvements and regressions land as new frozen rounds with a `Delta vs v(N-1)` table; vibes-based "feels faster now" claims are out of scope.

For agent-tool *budget* questions (does an agent reach for the graph, does it save tokens), see the closed [`benchmarks/graph/`](../graph/) series — that's a different benchmark with a different `kind`.

## Scope

Two phases per (corpus × tool) cell:

- **Build phase** — cold full index of the corpus, then warm incremental rebuild after a controlled mutation (rename / content edit / move).
- **Query phase** — N seeded calls per tool per corpus, distribution reported as p50/p90/p99.

Tools in scope (one cell per): `orbit.graph.overview`, `search`, `callers`, `deps`, `refs`, `show`, `implementors`, `history`, `pack` — all 9 graph MCP tools.

## Corpus matrix

One tier per language — Python, Java, TypeScript — at the `medium` (~250k LOC) target. v1 is intentionally a tight baseline: one corpus per language, no tier comparison. The `small` tier (~10k LOC) is omitted because it gives little signal — most graph operations are sub-100ms there and the cost dynamics that matter only show up at medium and above. The `large` tier (~700k+ LOC) is deferred until the graph design is known to handle that regime cleanly. Future rounds reintroduce tiers as the design proves out.

Concrete `<org>/<repo>@<sha>` pins are recorded in each round's `vN/METHOD.md`. Fixtures live outside the repo — `scripts/fetch.sh` clones into `~/.cache/orbit-bench/<corpus>` on first run.

## Reproducing

```bash
# Fetch corpora (one-time, ~few GB on first run)
make -C benchmarks graph-latency-fetch

# Single cell
GRAPH_LATENCY_VERSION=v2 make -C benchmarks graph-latency-run \
  GL_CORPUS=python-medium GL_TOOL=graph.search GL_PHASE=query GL_SEED=1

# Full sweep
GRAPH_LATENCY_VERSION=v2 make -C benchmarks graph-latency-sweep

# Aggregate
GRAPH_LATENCY_VERSION=v2 make -C benchmarks graph-latency-aggregate
```

## Outputs

```text
benchmarks/graph-latency/<version>/runs/<corpus>/<tool>/<phase>/<seed>.json
```

Each record (`<seed>.json`) contains `wall_ms`, `rss_peak_mb`, `result_size_bytes`, `result_count`, plus host metadata and `orbit_sha` / `corpus_sha` pins. Per-cell record schema is documented in `vN/METHOD.md`.

## Rounds

| Version | Scope | Status | Report |
|---|---|---|---|
| [v1](./v1/) | First baseline; Python + Java + TypeScript at medium × 9 tools | FROZEN | [RESULTS.md](./v1/RESULTS.md) |
| [v2](./v2/) | TBD — measurement variable not yet fixed | LIVING | [RESULTS.md](./v2/RESULTS.md) |
