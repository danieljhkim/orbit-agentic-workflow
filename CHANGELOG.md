# Changelog

## 0.2.0

### Features

- **Parallel batch execution**: dispatch and execute multiple tasks in parallel with file-level conflict detection and shared worktrees
- **Auto-cleanup on merge**: ship workflow now deletes the remote branch after a successful PR merge

### Fixes

- **`--parallelism` flag**: serialized as JSON integer instead of string, fixing schema validation failure on `orbit run ship --parallelism N`
- **Stale default artifacts**: `orbit workspace init` now always refreshes default skills, activities, and jobs to their latest embedded versions (custom artifacts are preserved)
- **Clippy warning**: resolved unused-mut warning and removed clippy from CI

### Chores

- Default branch renamed from `agent-main` to `main`
- Removed `orbit` label from PR creation
- Agent configuration updates

## 0.1.0

Initial release of Orbit.

### Core

- **Task lifecycle**: propose, approve, implement, review, and archive tasks with full history tracking
- **Activity system**: reusable operations with defined input/output schemas and three spec types (agent_invoke, cli_command, automation)
- **Job engine**: composable multi-step pipelines with conditional execution, retry logic, nested jobs, and parallel dispatch
- **Workflow aliases**: `orbit run ship`, `orbit run ship-local`, `orbit run review` as ergonomic entry points over raw job invocation
- **Multi-agent orchestration**: parallel task workers with file-level locking in shared worktrees
- **Multi-model strategy**: configurable agent/model per job step (e.g., Opus for planning, Codex for implementation)

### CLI

- Grouped command surface: run workflows, manage work, configure and inspect
- JSON and table output modes across all commands
- Audit event logging for every CLI invocation

### Infrastructure

- Layered Rust crate architecture (types, policy, exec, tools, store, agent, engine, core, cli)
- Two-root workspace model: global (`~/.orbit/`) and workspace-local (`.orbit/`)
- File-based (YAML) and SQLite persistence
- RBAC policy evaluation engine
- Process sandboxing and timeout handling
- Skill system for agent prompt composition
