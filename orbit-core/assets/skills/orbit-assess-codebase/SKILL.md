name: orbit-assess-codebase
description: Use for a comprehensive evaluation of the codebase to identify strengths, weaknesses, risks, and improvement opportunities. This skill is typically requested periodically by scheduled orbit-job, orbit-task, or human. Use this skill only when explicitly requested to "orbit-assess-codebase".

# Orbit Assess Codebase

## Purpose

Perform a holistic, senior-level evaluation of the project, focusing on:

- System architecture and modularity
- Code quality and maintainability
- Security posture
- Performance and efficiency
- Developer experience (DX)
- User experience (UX), if applicable
- Testing strategy and coverage
- Operational readiness

Deliver:

- A structured assessment
- Clear strengths and weaknesses
- Risk analysis
- Prioritized improvement roadmap
- Thoughtful feature expansion ideas

All findings of issues must be emitted and audited in a structured form suitable for issue tracking. New issues must be tracked by utilizing `orbit-track-issues` skill.

---

## Assessment Workflow

1. Understand the project’s purpose and target users.
2. Review repository structure, layering boundaries, and dependency flow.
3. Evaluate testing strategy, determinism, and failure-path coverage.
4. Assess performance characteristics, scaling risks, and operational readiness.
5. Review security posture and threat surface.
6. Identify UX/DX friction, architectural smells, and technical debt.
7. Propose a prioritized improvement roadmap and feature opportunities.
8. Turn each issue finding into a tracked issue by invoking `orbit-track-issues` (do not create issue files directly).
9. Write the assessment to `{{ORBIT_ROOT}}/agents/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-<title>.md`.

## Assessment Rules

- Be objective and evidence-driven.
- Distinguish observation from recommendation.
- Avoid vague statements; be concrete.
- Identify trade-offs explicitly.
- Do not implement or rewrite code during assessment.
- If context is insufficient, ask focused clarifying questions.
- Use ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) in filenames and dates.
- Do not overwrite existing assessments unless explicitly instructed.
- Treat each assessment as a point-in-time snapshot.
- If profile.yaml enables auto issue creation, ensure all findings at or above threshold include clear Title, Severity, Impact, and Recommended Action fields.
- Production Sign-Off must be NO if any High severity Production Blocking risk exists.
- When creating issues from findings, the agent must delegate issue creation to the `orbit-track-issues` skill rather than writing issue files directly.
- For delegated issue task creation, attribution should use identity details when available; otherwise use model name fallback for `assigned_to` and `created_by`, and set `identity_id` only when model-alias identity exists.
