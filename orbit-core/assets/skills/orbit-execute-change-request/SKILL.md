# Orbit Execute Change Request

## Purpose

Handle a human-requested engineering change or existing Orbit task from intent to verified implementation, with explicit task lifecycle tracking.

## Command Reference

All agent Orbit interactions go through `orbit tool run`. **Never guess command names — use exactly these:**

Include your identity on every `orbit tool run orbit.*` call by passing `agent` and `model` in the input JSON. Orbit uses these fields to write precise task provenance (`history`, `assigned_to`, comments, and task metadata) instead of the generic `agent` label.

```bash
# Load a task
orbit tool run orbit.task.show --input '{"id": "<task-id>", "agent": "<agent>", "model": "<model>"}'

# Start a task (backlog/proposed -> in-progress)
orbit tool run orbit.task.start --input '{"id": "<task-id>", "note": "<why>", "agent": "<agent>", "model": "<model>"}'

# Update task status
orbit tool run orbit.task.update --input '{"id": "<task-id>", "status": "review", "agent": "<agent>", "model": "<model>"}'

# Update execution summary
orbit tool run orbit.task.update --input '{"id": "<task-id>", "execution_summary": "<summary>", "agent": "<agent>", "model": "<model>"}'

# Add a comment
orbit tool run orbit.task.update --input '{"id": "<task-id>", "comment": "<what happened>", "agent": "<agent>", "model": "<model>"}'

# List tasks
orbit tool run orbit.task.list --input '{"status": "backlog", "agent": "<agent>", "model": "<model>"}'
```

**Important:** Always use `orbit tool run` — never use `orbit task ...` directly. The tool interface tracks agent provenance. Direct CLI usage is reserved for humans.

**If running from a worktree**, pass `--root` pointing to the original repo's `.orbit` directory so commands resolve correctly.

## Common Mistakes — DO NOT

Agents frequently make these mistakes. **Read this before running any command.**

| Mistake | Why it fails | Correct form |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| `cargo run -- tool run orbit.task.show ...` | `cargo run` rebuilds from source; agents must use the installed binary | `orbit tool run orbit.task.show ...` |
| `orbit task show ...` | Direct CLI subcommands are for humans; agent provenance is not recorded | `orbit tool run orbit.task.show ...` |
| `orbit tool run orbit.task.transition ...` | `orbit.task.transition` does not exist — there is no such tool | `orbit tool run orbit.task.start ...` or `orbit tool run orbit.task.update ...` |
| `orbit tool run orbit.task.move ...` | `orbit.task.move` does not exist | `orbit tool run orbit.task.update --input '{"id":"...","status":"..."}'` |
| `orbit tool run orbit.task.comment ...` | `orbit.task.comment` does not exist | `orbit tool run orbit.task.update --input '{"id":"...","comment":"..."}'` |

**Rule:** If a tool name is not listed in the Command Reference above, it does not exist. Never invent tool names. Run `orbit tool list` to see all registered tools.

## When Commands Fail

If any `orbit tool run` command fails unexpectedly (unknown tool, missing field, unclear error), **do not silently work around it**. Immediately create a friction task:

```bash
orbit tool run orbit.task.add --input '{"title": "<short problem statement>", "description": "<what command failed, the error message, and why it caused friction>", "type": "issue", "priority": "medium", "agent": "<agent>", "model": "<model>"}'
```

Then continue with your work. The friction must be recorded so it gets fixed for the next agent.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load or create the task

**If given an existing task ID**, load it:

```bash
orbit tool run orbit.task.show --input '{"id": "<task-id>", "agent": "<agent>", "model": "<model>"}'
```

Read the returned JSON carefully. Extract:
- `description` and `acceptance_criteria` — these define the required outcome.
- `plan` — if blank or placeholder text, author a fresh execution plan before starting work.
- `context_files` — read each file listed before making changes.
- `status` — confirms the task is ready to start.

**If this is a new change request** (no task ID), clarify intent and success criteria with the human, then create a task using `orbit-create-task`.

### Step 2: Plan the task

If the task does not already have a real, current plan, write one first:

```bash
orbit tool run orbit.task.update --input '{"id": "<task-id>", "plan": "<markdown plan>", "agent": "<agent>", "model": "<model>"}'
```

- Use the task description and acceptance criteria as the source of truth.
- Replace placeholder plans like `To be authored by executing agent at start time.`
- Keep the plan concrete: likely files, validation commands, and major risks.

### Step 3: Start the task

```bash
orbit tool run orbit.task.start --input '{"id": "<task-id>", "note": "<why this is ready now>", "agent": "<agent>", "model": "<model>"}'
```

- `task start` moves `backlog -> in-progress`
- `task start` also handles `proposed -> in-progress` and records `proposal_approved` before `started`
- `task start` will fail if the task still lacks a real plan
- Keep using explicit `approve` plus later status updates when approval and execution should stay separate

### Step 4: Implement and validate

Follow the task's `plan` field step by step. Read the `context_files` before touching code. If the plan has verification commands, run them.

### Step 5: Move to review

```bash
orbit tool run orbit.task.update --input '{"id": "<task-id>", "status": "review", "agent": "<agent>", "model": "<model>"}'
```

### Step 6: Persist the execution summary

See Output section below.

## Lifecycle Rules

- Manage a single Orbit task per change request.
- If material ambiguity remains, ask clarifying questions before implementation.
- If approval cannot be obtained for `proposed` work, stop after recording that state instead of calling `task start`.
- Do not skip lifecycle updates.

## Output

Persist the execution summary via the Orbit task update tool — do NOT write to a file path directly:

```bash
orbit tool run orbit.task.update --input '{
  "id": "<task-id>",
  "execution_summary": "<summary content>",
  "agent": "<agent>",
  "model": "<model>"
}'
```

The Orbit task tool resolves the correct bundle path automatically. Never hardcode or guess the file location.

Use this structure for the execution summary:

```markdown
# Execution Summary - <Change Request Title>
Agent Name: <agent_name>
Agent Model: <model name>

## Status
success | failed

## Orbit Task
Task ID: <orbit-task-id>

## 1. Summary of Changes
<what changed>
## 2. Strategic Decisions
- <decision> | Rationale: <why> | Trade-offs: <trade-offs>
## 3. Assumptions Made
- <assumption> | Impact if incorrect: <impact>
## 4. Design Weaknesses / Risks
- <risk> | Severity: Low / Medium / High | Mitigation: <mitigation>
## 5. Deviations from Original Plan
- <deviation> | Justification: <why>
## 6. Technical Debt Introduced
- <item> | Recommended resolution: <next step>
## 7. Recommended Follow-Ups
- <next step>
## 8. Overall Assessment
<short quality assessment>
```

## Exit Criteria

- Requested change implemented
- Validation completed
- Task started via `orbit tool run orbit.task.start` with explicit `agent` and `model` before execution
- Task advanced through `review`
- Execution summary persisted via `orbit tool run orbit.task.update --input '{"id": "...", "execution_summary": "...", "agent": "...", "model": "..."}'`
