# Orbit Execute Change Request

## Purpose

Handle a human-requested engineering change or existing Orbit task from intent to verified implementation, with explicit task lifecycle tracking in `orbit task`.

## Responsibilities

1. Clarify intent and success criteria.
2. Create or link the tracking task in Orbit. If creating, use `orbit-create-task`.
3. Ensure `proposed` work is explicitly approved before execution.
4. Move `backlog -> in-progress` before making changes.
5. Implement and validate the change according to the task plan.
6. Move `in-progress -> review` after validation.
7. Persist the execution summary in the linked task bundle.

Use `orbit-manage-tasks` for canonical CLI mutation and verification details.

## Lifecycle Rules

- Manage a single Orbit task per change request.
- If material ambiguity remains, ask clarifying questions before implementation.
- If approval cannot be obtained for `proposed` work, stop after recording that state.
- Do not skip lifecycle updates.

## Output

Persist the execution summary via the CLI — do NOT write to a file path directly:

```bash
orbit task update <task-id> --execution-summary "$(cat <<'EOF'
<summary content>
EOF
)"
```

The CLI resolves the correct bundle path automatically. Never hardcode or guess the file location.

Use this structure for the summary content:

```markdown
# Execution Summary - <Change Request Title>
Agent Name: <identity_display_name>
Agent Model: <model name>

## Status
success | failed

## Orbit Task
Task ID: <orbit-task-id>

## 1. Summary of Changes
<what changed>
## 2. Strategic Decisions
- <decision> | Rationale: <why> | Trade-offs: <trade-offs>
## 3. Assumptions Made
- <assumption> | Impact if incorrect: <impact>
## 4. Design Weaknesses / Risks
- <risk> | Severity: Low / Medium / High | Mitigation: <mitigation>
## 5. Deviations from Original Plan
- <deviation> | Justification: <why>
## 6. Technical Debt Introduced
- <item> | Recommended resolution: <next step>
## 7. Recommended Follow-Ups
- <next step>
## 8. Overall Assessment
<short quality assessment>
```

## Exit Criteria

- Requested change implemented
- Validation completed
- Task approved before execution, if required
- Task advanced through `review`
- Summary written to `execution-summary.md`
