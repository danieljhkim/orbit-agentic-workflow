# Orbit Maintain System

## Purpose

Use this skill for explicitly requested maintenance that is safe, incremental, and does not change intended behavior.

## Responsibilities

1. Assess system health and identify maintenance issues.
2. Track every discovered issue via a new Orbit task.
3. Apply low-risk maintenance such as formatting, dead code removal, small dependency updates, or minor cleanup.
4. Verify integrity after changes with build/tests/lint as applicable.
5. Persist a markdown maintenance summary report.

## Issue Tracking Contract

When maintenance finds any issue, create a tracking task immediately.

- Create one Orbit task per issue discovered.
- Use `--type issue` for defects/risks and `--type chore` only for clearly non-defect maintenance work.
- Map severity to `--priority` (`high`, `medium`, `low`).
- Record created task IDs in the final report.
- If no issues are found, say "No maintenance issues found".

Use `orbit-create-task` for task creation details.

## Execution Rules

- Preserve observable behavior.
- Prefer minimal, incremental changes.
- Avoid breaking API or schema contracts.
- Abort on validation failure.
- Produce reviewable diffs.
- Do not silently ignore discovered issues.

## Output

Write the report to `{{ORBIT_ROOT}}/agents/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/maintenance_<title>.md`.

Use this structure:

```markdown
# Maintenance Summary - <Title>
Agent Name: <agent_name>
Agent Model: <model name>

## Status
success | failed
## Scope
<paths/components reviewed>
## Actions Performed
- <action>
## Files Modified
- <file path>
## Validation
- Build: pass | fail | skipped
- Tests: pass | fail | skipped
- Lint: pass | fail | skipped
## Issues Found
- <issue summary>
## Orbit Tasks Created
- <TASK_ID> - <title> (priority: <low|medium|high>, status: <status>)
## Notes
<follow-ups, risks, blockers>
```

## Result Contract

After writing the report, return the following JSON result:

```json
{
  "comment": "<one-line summary of what was done>"
}
```

Do not include a `commit` field. Orbit does not auto-commit reports or other agent-created files.

## Operational Audit (Job Runs)

When asked to perform an operational audit:

**1. Archive successful runs**

```bash
orbit tool run orbit.job_run.list --input '{"status": "success"}'
orbit tool run orbit.job_run.archive --input '{"id": "<job_run_id>"}'   # repeat for each result
```

**2. Inspect failed runs**

```bash
orbit tool run orbit.job_run.list --input '{"status": "failed"}'
```

If none, report operations are healthy and stop.

```bash
orbit tool run orbit.job_run.show --input '{"id": "<job_run_id>"}'   # review: job_id, command, error, exit code, timestamps
```

**3. Create one remediation task per failure**

```bash
orbit tool run orbit.task.add --input '{
  "type": "issue",
  "title": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "plan": "...",
  "workspace": "."
}'
```

Record created task IDs in the report.

## Operational Audit (Friction Logs)

When asked to inspect recurring friction:

1. Read the current month of friction logs from `.orbit/diagnostics/friction/YYYY-MM/`.
2. Group entries by recurring pattern using `command` + `stderr` (or a normalized error summary when stderr is noisy).
3. Only create remediation tasks for patterns that occur 3 or more times in the month.
4. Include the grouped counts and any created task IDs in the report.

Focus on recurring operational drag, not one-off failures that already have an obvious local explanation.

## Exit Criteria

- Assessment completed
- Every discovered issue tracked
- Maintenance actions completed or safely skipped
- Validation completed
- Report written to the correct location
- Result returned with `comment`
